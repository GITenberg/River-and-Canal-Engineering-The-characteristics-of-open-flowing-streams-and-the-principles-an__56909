<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The object of this book is to describe the principles and
practice adopted in the Engineering of Open Streams.
If the book seems to be somewhat small for its object,
it will, it is hoped, be found that this is due to care
in the arrangement and wording.</p>

<p>Sources of information have been acknowledged in
the text, but special mention may be made of lectures
given by Professor Unwin at Coopers Hill College, of
Harcourt’s large work on <i>Rivers and Canals</i>, of the
papers<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> by Binnie on rainfall, by Shaw on the closing
of the river Tista, by Harcourt on movable weirs and
on estuaries, by Strange on reservoirs, and by Ottley and
Brightmore, Gore and Wilson, and Hill on the stresses
in masonry dams; of the articles by Bligh<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> on weirs
with porous foundations and by Deacon<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> on reservoir
capacity, of the Indian Government paper by Spring on
“River Control on the Guide Bank System,” and of the
Punjab Government paper containing Kennedy’s remarks
on silting and scour in the Sirhind Canal. The two
papers last mentioned are not easily accessible, and they
contain matter of great interest. The important points,
often obscured by masses of detail or figures, have been
extracted.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span></p>

<p>Silting and scour (<a href="#CHAPTER_IV"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span></a>) had already been dealt
with in <i>Hydraulics</i>,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> but some further information has
since come to light and the subject has been treated
afresh and the matter re-written.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="large">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_I_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;River and Canal Engineering
is that branch of engineering science which deals
with the characteristics of streams flowing in open
channels, and with the principles and methods which
should be followed in dealing with, altering, and controlling
them. It is not necessary to make a general
distinction between natural and artificial streams; some
irrigation canals or other artificial channels are as large
as rivers and have many of the same characteristics.
Any special remarks applicable to either class will be
given as occasion requires.</h3>

<h3 id="Chap_I_Art_2">2. <b>Résumé of the Subject.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chap. II.</a></span> of this book
deals with the collection of information concerning
streams, a procedure which is necessary before any
considerable work in connection with a stream can be
undertaken, and often before it can even be decided
whether or not it is to be undertaken. <span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_III">Chap. III.</a></span> deals
with rainfall, and describes how rainfall figures and
statistics can be utilised by the engineer in dealing
with streams.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_IV">Chap. IV.</a></span> explains the laws of silting and scouring
action, a subject of great importance and one to which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the attention ordinarily given is insufficient. The
general characteristics of streams, being due entirely
to silting or scouring tendencies, are included in this
chapter. <a href="#CHAPTER_V"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span></a> describes how silting or scouring
may be, under some circumstances, artificially induced
or retarded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_VI">Chap. VI.</a></span> deals with various methods of protecting
banks against erosion or damage. <a href="#CHAPTER_VII"><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span></a> treats of
diversions or the opening out of new channels, and
with the opposite of this, viz. the closing of channels, a
feat which, when the stream is flowing, is sometimes
very difficult to achieve. This chapter also deals with
dredging and excavation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_VIII">Chap. VIII.</a></span> discusses the subject of the training of
streams, a class of work which is generally undertaken
in order to make them navigable or to improve their
existing capacities for navigation, but may be undertaken
for other reasons. The main features of this
kind of work are the narrowing and deepening of the
stream, often the reduction of the velocity and slope,
and generally the raising of the water-level. In this
kind of work a channel may be completely remodelled
and even new reaches constructed. <a href="#CHAPTER_IX"><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span></a> deals
with artificial channels of earth or masonry, and includes
navigation canals.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>In <span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chaps. X.</a></span> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XI">XI.</a> the chief masonry works or
isolated structures&mdash;as distinguished from general works
which extend over considerable lengths of channel&mdash;are
dealt with, and those principles of design discussed
which affect the works in their hydraulic capacities.
General principles of design applicable to all kinds of
works, such as the thicknesses of arches or retaining
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
walls, are not considered; they can be found in books
on general engineering design.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Chap. XII.</a></span> treats of storm waters and river floods,
and shows how works can be designed for getting rid
of flood water and how floods can be mitigated or
prevented, one of the chief measures, the widening of
the channel and the lowering of the water-level, being
the opposite of that adopted for training works.
Embankments for stopping flooding are also dealt with.
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII"><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span></a> deals with reservoirs, including the design
of earthen and masonry dams.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chaps. XIV.</a></span> and <a href="#CHAPTER_XV">XV.</a> deal with tidal waters, river
mouths and estuaries, and works in connection with
them, viz. the training of estuaries and the methods
of dealing with bars, the object being in all cases the
improvement of the navigable capacities of the channels.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_I_Art_3">3. <b>Design and Execution of Works.</b>&mdash;After obtaining
full information concerning the stream to be dealt
with, careful calculations are, in the case of any large
and important work, made as to the effects which will
be produced by it. These effects cannot always be
exactly foreseen. Sometimes matters can be arranged so
that the work can be stopped short at some stage without
destroying the utility of the portion done, or so that
the completed work can be altered to some extent.</h3>

<p>In works for controlling streams there is, as will
appear in due course, a considerable choice of types of
work and methods of construction. In practice it will
generally be found that there are, in any particular
locality, reasons for giving preference to one particular
type or kind of work or, at all events, that the choice is
limited to a few of them, either because certain kinds of
materials and appliances can be obtained more cheaply
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and readily than others, or because works of a particular
type have already been successfully adopted there, or
because the people of the district are accustomed to
certain classes of work or methods of construction. In
out-of-the-way places it is often undesirable to avoid
any type of work which cannot be quickly repaired or
readily kept in order by such means as exist near
the spot.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that perishable materials, such as
trees, stakes, and brushwood, cannot produce permanent
results. They can produce results which will last for a
long time and which may even be permanent. By the
time the materials have decayed, the changes wrought
may have been very great, deposits of shingle or silt
may have occurred and become covered with vegetation,
and there may be little tendency for matters to revert
to their former condition. If the expense of using more
lasting materials had had to be incurred, the works
might never have been carried out at all. On the
Mississippi enormous quantities of work have been
done with fascines.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_I_Art_4">4. <b>The Hydraulics of Open Streams.</b>&mdash;When any
reach of a stream is altered, say by widening, narrowing,
or deepening, so that the water-level is changed, there
will also be a change in the water-level, a gradually
diminishing change, for some distance upstream of the
reach. Also in the lowest portion of the reach the
change will gradually diminish and it will vanish at the
extreme downstream end of the reach. In the next
lowest reach there is no change. Thus if it is desired
that the change in the water-level shall take full effect
throughout the whole of a reach, the change in the
channel must be carried further down. If a weir is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
built there is no change in the water-level downstream
of it except such as may be due to loss of water in the
reach upstream of it. The above points are mentioned
here because, although they are really questions of
hydraulics, they are of much importance and of very
general application.</h3>

<p>Matters connected with the hydraulics of open streams
seem to lend themselves in a peculiar way to loosely
expressed remarks and fallacious opinions. The set of a
stream towards a bank is sometimes supposed to profoundly
affect the discharge of a diversion or branch.
Its effect is simply that of “velocity of approach,”
which, as is well known, is quite small with ordinary
velocities, and is merely equivalent to a very small
increase of head. Narrow bridges or other works are
sometimes said to seriously “obstruct” a stream without
any observations being made of the fall in the water
surface through the bridge. This fall is the only
measure of the real obstruction.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="large">RAINFALL</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_II_Art_1">1. <b>Rainfall Statistics.</b>&mdash;The mean annual rainfall
varies very greatly according to the locality. In
England it varies from about 20 inches at Hunstanton
in Cambridgeshire, to about 200 inches at Seathwaite
in Cumberland; in India, from 2 or 3 inches in parts
of Scinde, to 450 inches or more at Cherrapunji in the
Eastern Himalayas.</h3>

<p>Rain is brought by winds which blow across the sea.
Hence the rainfall in any country is generally greatest
in those localities where the prevailing winds blow
from seaward, provided they have travelled a great
distance over the sea. Rainfall is greater among hills
than elsewhere, because the temperature at great elevations
is lower. Currents of moist air striking the hills
are deflected upwards, become cooled, and the water
vapour becomes rain. This process, if the hills are not
lofty, may not produce its full effect till the air currents
have passed over the hills, and thus the rainfall on the
leeward slopes may be greater than elsewhere, but on
the inner and more lofty ranges the rainfall is generally
greatest on the windward side.</p>

<p>Thus the rainfall may vary greatly at places not far
apart. An extreme instance of this occurs in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Bombay hills, where the mean annual falls at two
stations only ten miles apart are respectively 300 inches
and 50 inches.</p>

<p>In temperate climates the rainfall is generally distributed
over all the months of the year; in the tropics
the great bulk of the rain often falls in a few months.</p>

<p>The fall at any one place varies greatly from year to
year. To obtain really reliable figures concerning any
place, observations at that place should extend over a
period of thirty to thirty-five years. The figures of the
mean annual fall will then probably be correct to within
2 per cent. The degree of accuracy to be expected in
results deduced from observations extending over shorter
periods is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>No. of years</td>
    <td class="tdc">25</td>
    <td class="tdc">20</td>
    <td class="tdc">15</td>
    <td class="tdc">10</td>
    <td class="tdc">5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Error per cent.</td>
    <td class="tdc">3</td>
    <td class="tdc">3¼</td>
    <td class="tdc">5</td>
    <td class="tdc">8</td>
    <td class="tdc">15</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>These figures were deduced by Binnie (<i>Min. Proc. Inst.
C.E.</i>, vol. cix.) from an examination of rainfall figures
obtained over long periods of time at many places scattered
over the world. The errors may, of course, be plus
or minus. They are the averages of the errors actually
found, and are themselves subject to fluctuations. Thus
the 15 per cent. error for a five-year period may be
16 or 13, the 8 per cent. error for a ten-year period
may be 8½ or 7½, with similar but minute fluctations
for the other periods.</p>

<p>Binnie’s figures also show that the ratio of the fall at
any place in the driest year to the mean annual fall,
averages ·51 to ·68, with a general average of ·60, and
that the ratio in the wettest year to the mean annual
fall averages 1·41 to 1·75, with a general average of
1·51. For India the general averages are ·50 and 1·75.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
These figures are useful as a means of estimating the
probable greatest and least annual fall, but they are
averages for groups of places. The greatest fall at any
particular place may occasionally be twice the mean
annual fall. At some places in India, in Mauritius, and
at Marseilles it has been two and a half times the mean
annual fall. The least annual fall may, in India, be as
low as ·27 of the mean. In England the fall in a dry
year has, once at least, been found to be only ·30 of the
mean annual fall. The mean fall (average for all places)
in the three driest years is, from Binnie’s figures, about
·76 of the mean annual fall. The figures given above,
except when a particular country is mentioned, apply
to all countries and to places where the rainfall is heavy,
as well as to those where it is light. But in extremely
dry places the fluctuations are likely to be much greater.
At Kurrachee, with a mean annual fall of only 7·5 inches,
the fall in a very wet year has been found to be 3·73
times, and in a very dry year only ·07 times the mean
annual fall.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom the probable rainfall at any
place in the driest year may be taken as ·63 of the
mean annual fall. For periods of two, three, four, five
and six consecutive dry years, the figures are ·72, ·77,
·80, ·82, and ·835. These figures are of importance in
calculations for the capacity of reservoirs (<a href="#Chap_XIII_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span>,
<i>Art. 2</i></a>).</p>

<p>When accurate statistics of rainfall are required for
any work, the rainfall of the tract concerned must be
specially studied and local figures obtained for as many
years as possible. Very frequently it is necessary to
set up a rain-gauge, or several if the tract is extensive
or consists of several areas at different elevations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
Sometimes there is only a year or so in which to collect
figures. In this case the ratio of the observed fall to
that, for the same period, at the nearest station where
regular records are kept, is calculated. This ratio is
assumed to hold good throughout, and thus the probable
rainfall figures for the new station can be obtained for
the whole period over which the records have been
kept at the regular station. The volumes of the British
Rainfall Organisation contain a vast amount of information
regarding rainfall. For a large area there should
be one rain-gauge for every 500 acres, for a small area
more. In the case of a valley there should be at least
three gauges along the line of the deepest part&mdash;one at
the highest point, one at the lowest, and one midway
as regards height&mdash;and two gauges half way up the
sides and opposite the middle gauge (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, Tenth
Edition, vol. xxxiii.). Some extra gauges may be set up
for short periods in order to see whether the regular
gauges give fair indications of the rainfall of the tract.
If they do not do so some allowances can be made
for this.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_II_Art_2">2. <b>Available Rainfall.</b>&mdash;The area drained by a stream
is called its “catchment area” or “basin.” The available
rainfall in a catchment area is the total fall less the
quantity which is evaporated or absorbed by vegetation.
The evaporation does not chiefly take place directly from
the surface. Rain sinks a short distance into the ground,
and is subsequently evaporated. The available rainfall
does not all flow directly into the streams. Some sinks
deep into the ground and forms springs, and these many
months later augment the flow of the stream and maintain
it in dry seasons. The available rainfall of a given
catchment area is known as the “yield” of that area.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></h3>

<p>Estimation of the available rainfall is necessary
chiefly in cases where water is to be stored in reservoirs
for town supply or irrigation. The ratio of the available
to the total rainfall depends chiefly on the nature
and steepness of the surface of the catchment area, on
the temperature and dryness of the air, and on the
amount and distribution of the rainfall. The ratio is
far greater when the falls are heavy than when they
are light. Again, when the ground is fairly dry and the
temperature high&mdash;as in summer in England&mdash;nearly
the whole of the rainfall may evaporate; but when the
ground is soaked and the temperature low&mdash;as in late
autumn and winter in England&mdash;the bulk of the rainfall
runs off. In the eighteen years from 1893 to 1900
the average discharge of the Thames at Teddington,
after allowing for abstractions by water companies, was
in July, August, and September 12 per cent. of the rainfall&mdash;6·9
inches&mdash;in its basin, and in January, February,
and March 60 per cent. of the fall which was 5·9 inches.
The total fall in the year was 26·4 inches. Some
rivers in Spain discharge, in years of heavy rainfall,
39 per cent., and in years of light rainfall 9 per cent.
of the rainfall (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. clxvii.).
The discharge of a river is not always greatest in the
month, or even the year, of greatest rainfall.</p>

<p>The table opposite gives some figures obtained by
comparison of rainfall figures and stream discharges.
The case of the area of 2208 acres near Cape Town is
described in a paper by Bartlett (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>,
vol. clxxxviii.), and it is shown by figures that part of
the rainfall in the rainy season went to increase the
underground supply which afterwards maintained the
flow in the dry season.

<p>Rankine gives the ratio of the available rainfall to
the whole fall as 1·0 on steep rocks, ·8 to ·6 on moorland
and hilly pasture, ·5 to ·4 on flat, cultivated
country, and nil on chalk. These figures are only rough.
The figures for rocks and pastures are too high. The
loss from evaporation and absorption is not proportional
to the rainfall. It is far more correct to consider
the loss as a fairly constant quantity in any given
locality but increasing somewhat when the rainfall is
great. The available rainfall in Great Britain has
generally been overestimated. Sometimes it has been
taken as being ·60 of the whole fall. More commonly
the loss is taken to be 13 to 15 inches. This is correct
for the western mountain districts, where the rainfall is
about 80 inches and the soil consists chiefly of rocks
partly covered with moorland or pasture. In other
parts of the country, especially where flat, the loss is
often 17 to 20 inches. All the above figures are,
however, general averages. The proper estimation of
the available rainfall at any place in any country
depends a great deal on experience and judgment, and
on the extent to which figures for actual cases of
similar character are available. Regarding the “run-off”
from saturated land during short periods, see
<a href="#Chap_XII_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>, <i>Arts. 1</i></a> and <a href="#Chap_XII_Art_2"><i>2</i>.</a></p>

<h3 id="Chap_II_Art_3">3. <b>Measurement of Rainfall.</b>&mdash;A rain-gauge should
be in open ground and not sheltered by objects of any
kind. The ordinary rain-gauge is a short cylinder.
This is often connected by a tapering piece to a longer
cylinder of smaller diameter. In this the rain is stored
safely and is measured by a graduated rod. The
measurement can be made more accurately than if the
diameter was throughout the same as at the top. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
other cases the water is poured out of the cylinder into
a measuring vessel. If the rain-gauge was sunk so that
the top was level with the ground, rain falling outside
the gauge would splash into it and vitiate the
readings unless the gauge was surrounded by a trench.
Ordinarily the top of the gauge is from 1 to 3 feet
above the ground. When it is 1 metre above the
ground the rain registered is said to be on the average
about 6 per cent. less than it should be, owing to the
fact that wind causes eddies and currents and carries
away drops which should have fallen into the gauge.
The velocity of the wind increases with the height
above the ground, and so does the error of the rain-gauge.
Devices for getting rid of the eddies have been
invented by Boernstein and Nipher (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, Tenth
Edition, vol. xviii.), but they have not yet come into
general use. The Boernstein device is being used
experimentally at Eskdalemuir. It would appear that
much splashing cannot take place when the ground is
covered with grass, and that in such a case the top of
the gauge could be 1 foot above the ground, thus
making the error very small.</h3>

<p>If the ground is at first level, then rises and then
again becomes level, a rain-gauge at the foot of the
slope will, with the prevailing wind blowing up the
slope, register too much, and a rain-gauge just beyond
the top of the slope will register too little (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>,
Tenth Edition, vol. xxxiii.).</p>

<h3 id="Chap_II_Art_4">4. <b>Influence of Forests and Vegetation.</b>&mdash;When
the ground is covered with vegetation, and especially
forests, the <i>humus</i> or mould formed from leaves, etc.,
absorbs and retains moisture. It acts like a reservoir,
so that the run-off takes place slowly and the denudation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and erosion of the soil is checked. The roots of the
trees or other vegetation also bind the soil together.
Vegetation and forests thus mitigate the severity of
floods and reduce the quantity of silt brought into the
streams. They also shield the ground from the direct
rays of the sun and so reduce evaporation, and thus,
on the whole, augment the available rainfall. Forests
render the climate more equable and tend to reduce the
temperature, and they thus, at least on hills, increase
the actual rainfall to some extent.</h3>

<p>If a forest is felled and replaced by cultivation, the
ploughing of the soil acts in the same way as the <i>humus</i>
of the forest, and the crops replace the trees; and it has
been stated that in the U.S.A. the cultivation is as
beneficial as the forests in mitigating floods and checking
denudation of the soil (<i>Proc. Am. Soc. C.E.</i>, vol.
xxxiv.). But when forests are felled they are not, at
least in hilly country, always replaced by cultivation.
Measures to put a stop to the destruction of forests or
to afforest or reforest bare land may enter into questions
of the régime of streams or the supply of water. On
the Rhine, increase in the severity of floods was distinctly
traced to deforestation of the drainage area.</p>

<p>It is usually said that forests act as reservoirs by
preventing snows from melting. This is disputed in
the paper above quoted, and it is stated that in the
absence of forests the snow forms drifts of enormous
depth, and these melt very gradually and act as reservoirs
after the snow in the forests has disappeared.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_II_Art_5">5. <b>Heavy Falls in Short Periods.</b>&mdash;When rain
water, instead of being stored or utilised, has to be got
rid of, it is of primary importance to estimate roughly&mdash;exact
estimates are impossible&mdash;the greatest probable fall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
in a short time. This bears a rough ratio to the mean
annual fall. The maximum observed falls in twenty-four
hours range, in the United Kingdom, generally from
·05 to ·10 of the mean annual fall&mdash;but on one occasion
the figure has been ·20,&mdash;and in the tropics from ·10 to
·25. Actual figures for particular places can be extracted
from the rain registers, but the probability of
their being exceeded must be taken into account. The
greatest fall observed in twenty-four hours in the United
Kingdom is 7 inches, and in India 30 inches in the
Eastern Himalayas.</h3>

<p>But much shorter periods than twenty-four hours
have to be dealt with. The following figures are given
by Chamier (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. cxxxiv.) as
applicable to New South Wales, and he considers that
they are fair guides, erring on the side of safety, for
other countries:&mdash;</p>

<p>The falls of 1 inch in ten minutes were frequently
observed near the head of the Upper Jhelum Canal, a
place where the annual rainfall is not more than 30
inches (see also <a href="#Chap_XII_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>, <i>Art. 1</i></a>). In some parts
of the Eastern Himalayas, where 30 inches of rain has
fallen in a day, it is possible that 8 inches may have
fallen in an hour. In England 4 inches has fallen in
an hour. The heaviest falls in short periods do not
usually occur in the wettest years, and they may occur
in very dry years. Nor do they always occur on a very
wet day.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="large">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION CONCERNING STREAMS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;The information which is
required concerning streams depends on the character
of the stream and on the nature of the work which is to
be done. For the present let it be supposed that the
stream is large and perennial. Other kinds of streams
will be dealt with in <i>Arts. 6</i> and <i>7</i>. In dealing with a
large perennial stream it is nearly always necessary to
know the approximate highest and lowest water-levels,
and these can generally be ascertained by local inquiry,
combined with observations of water marks; but a higher
level than the highest known and a lower level than
the lowest known are always liable to occur, and
must to some extent be allowed for. If navigation
exists or is to be arranged for, the highest and lowest
levels consistent with navigation must be ascertained.
The highest such level depends chiefly on the heights of
bridges. A plan to a fairly large scale is also necessary
in most cases.</h3>

<p>If an embankment to keep out floods is to be made
along a river which is so large that its flood-level cannot
be appreciably affected by the construction of the work,
it may be necessary to obtain information only as to the
actual flood-levels, and as to the extent to which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
stream is liable to erode its bank. If a length of the
bank of a stream has to be protected against scour, it is
necessary to know of what materials the bed and bank
are composed, and whether the channel is liable to
changes and to what extent. It is also desirable to
know to what extent the water transports solids, if
any. In some kinds of protective work these solids
are utilised.</p>

<p>But in cases where the stream is to be much interfered
with, it is necessary to have full information concerning
it, not only as regards water-levels, changes in the
channel, and transport of solids, but as regards the
longitudinal profile and cross-sections, and the discharges
corresponding to different water-levels. The
collection of some of this information, particularly as
to the water-levels and discharges at different times of
the year and in floods, may occupy a considerable time.</p>

<p>Methods of ascertaining the quantity of silt carried
in the water of a stream are described in <a href="#Chap_IV_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>,
<i>Art. 4</i></a>. Remarks regarding the other kinds of information
required&mdash;the stream being still supposed to be
large and perennial&mdash;are given in <i>Arts. 2</i> to <i>5</i> of this
chapter. The degree of accuracy required in the information
depends, however, on the importance of the
work, and sometimes the procedure can be simplified.
Detailed remarks on gauges and on the instruments
used and methods adopted for observing discharges and
surface slopes, are given in <i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>
and Appendix H.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_2">2. <b>Stream Gauges.</b>&mdash;Unless the stream being dealt
with is an artificial one, it is unlikely that the flow in
the reach with which the work is concerned will be
uniform. The rise and fall of the water at one place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
cannot therefore be correctly inferred from those at
another. It will be desirable to have two gauges,
either read daily or else automatically, recording the
water-level, one near each end of the reach concerned,
with intermediate gauges if the reach is very long. If,
in or near the reach, there is already a gauge which has
been regularly read, it may be sufficient to set up only
one new gauge, and to read it only for such a period of
time as will give a good range of water-level, and to
compare the readings with those of the old gauge. The
readings of the new gauge for water-levels outside the
range of those observed can then be inferred, but if the
stream is very irregular this may involve some trouble
(<i>Art. 4</i>).</h3>

<p>In the case of a large stream which shifts its course,
the reading of a gauge does not give a proper indication
of the water-level. In other words, the distance
of the gauge from the two ends of the reach is subject
to alteration. The case is the same as if the stream
was stable and the gauge was shifted about. In such
a stream there ought, if accuracy is required, to be a
group of two or more gauges for each point where there
would be only one if the stream was not a shifting one.
Also, owing to erosion of the bank or the formation of
a sandbank, it may often be necessary to shift the
gauge. When possible it should be kept in a fixed line
laid down at right angles to the general direction of
the stream. When shifted, its zero level should be
altered in such a way that the reading at the new site
at the time of shifting is the same as it was before
shifting. When the gauge is moved back to the
original site its zero should be placed at its original
level, though this may give rise to a sudden jump in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
the reading for the reason given in the first sentence
of this paragraph.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_3">3. <b>Plan and Sections.</b>&mdash;Making a survey and plan,
and laying down on it the lines for longitudinal and
cross-sections, and taking levels for the sections, are
ordinary operations of surveying. If any land is liable
to be flooded, its boundaries should be shown on the
plan and on some of the cross-sections. Unless the water
is shallow, it is necessary to obtain the bed levels from
the water-level by soundings, the level of a peg at the
water-level having been obtained by levelling. All the
sections should show the water-level as it was at some
particular time, but the water-level will probably have
altered while the survey was in progress, and allowance
must be made for this. The pegs at all the cross-sections
and on both banks of the stream&mdash;for the
water-levels at opposite banks may not be exactly the
same&mdash;may, for instance, be driven down to the water-level
when it is steady, and thereafter any changes in it
noted and the soundings corrected accordingly.</h3>

<p>In order to ascertain what changes are occurring in the
channel it may be necessary to repeat the soundings at
intervals and, if there is much erosion of the bank, to
make fresh plans.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_4">4. <b>Discharge Observations.</b>&mdash;For a large stream
it is necessary to observe the discharges by taking
cross-sections and measuring the velocity. If there
is a sufficient range of water-levels, it will be possible
to make actual observations of a sufficient number
of discharges. If soundings cannot, owing to the
depth or velocity, be taken at high water, they must
be inferred from those previously taken, but this
does not allow for changes in the channel, which are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
sometimes considerable and rapid. If there is not a
sufficient range of water-level, the discharges for some
water-levels must be calculated from those at other
water-levels. In this case observations of the surface
slope will be required, and the discharge site should be
so selected that no abrupt changes in the channel will
come within the length over which the observations are
to extend. This length should be such that the fall in
the water surface will be great enough to admit of
accurate observation. If the cross-section of the stream
is nearly uniform throughout the whole of this length,
or if it varies in a regular manner, being greatest at one
end of the length and least at the other end. the differences
in the areas of the two end sections being not
more than 10 or 12 per cent., then the velocity and
cross-section of the stream can be observed in the usual
manner at the centre of the length; but otherwise
they should be observed at intervals over the whole
length, or at least in two places, one where the section
is small and one where it is great, and the mean taken.
Or the velocity can be observed at only one cross-section
and calculated for the others by simple proportion and
the mean taken. The coefficient C can then be found
from the formula C = V/√(RS). To find the discharge for
a higher or lower water-level, the change in the value of
C corresponding to the change in R can be estimated by
looking out the values of C in tables, and the discharge
calculated by using the new values of C and R and the
new sectional area, S remaining unaltered. But if the
channel is such that, with the new water-level, a change
in S is likely to have occurred, this change must be
allowed for. Any such change will be due to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
changed relative effects of irregularities, either in the
length over which the observations extended or downstream
of that length. The effect of irregularities in
the bed is greatest at low water. The effect of lateral
narrowings is greatest at high water. Since a change of
10 per cent. in S causes a change of only 5 per cent. in
V, it will usually suffice to draw on the longitudinal
section the actual water surface observed and to sketch
the probable surface for the new water-level. If the
whole channel is fairly regular for a long distance downstream
of the discharge site, no slope observations need
be made nor need several sections be taken in order to
find V. The changed value of C should, however, be
estimated in the manner above indicated. For this
purpose any probable value of S will suffice.</h3>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_5">5. <b>Discharge Curves and Tables.</b>&mdash;Ordinarily it
will be possible, by plotting the observed discharges as
ordinates, the gauge readings being the abscissæ, to
draw a discharge curve and from it construct a discharge
table. Unless the channel is of firm material and not
liable to change, there are likely to be discrepancies
among the observed discharges, so that a regular discharge
curve will not pass through all the plotted
points. If the discrepancies are not serious, they can be
disregarded and the curve drawn so as to pass as near
as possible to all the points, but otherwise trouble and
uncertainty may arise. The soundings should be
compared in order to see whether changes have occurred
in the channel. If such changes do not account for the
discrepancies, the cause must be sought for in some of
the recorded velocities. If no sources of error in these
can be found, such as wind, it is possible that the
velocity has been affected by a change in the surface
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
slope owing to some change in the channel downstream
of the length. Failing this explanation, the discrepancies
must be set down to unknown causes. With an unstable
channel and where accuracy is required, the
sectional areas and velocities should be regularly
tabulated or plotted so that changes may be watched
and investigated. To do this it may be necessary to
take surface slope observations, or to set up extra gauges
which will show any changes in the slope.</h3>

<p>If, downstream of the discharge site, there is any
place where affluents come in and bring varying
volumes of water, or where gates or sluices are
manipulated, and if the influence of this extends up to
the discharge site, the water-level there no longer
depends only on the discharge, and a discharge table
must be one with several columns whose headings
indicate various conditions at the place where the
disturbances occur.</p>

<p>In order to show how the gauge readings and discharges
vary from day to day throughout the year, a
diagram should be prepared showing the gauge readings
and discharges as ordinates, the abscissæ being the
times in days starting from any convenient date as
zero. Such a diagram, showing only gauge readings,
is given in <a href="#fig_56">fig. 56</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XII"><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span></a></p>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_6">6. <b>Small Streams.</b>&mdash;Small streams will now be considered,
those, for instance, which are too small to be
navigable and which occasionally run dry or nearly dry.
If the water of the stream is to be stored for water
supply, power or irrigation purposes, full information as
to discharges and silt carried will be required. If the
stream is small enough the discharges can be ascertained
by means of a weir of planks. The discharge is then
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
known from the gauge readings. Cross-sections and
large scale plans will not be required unless the stream
is to be altered or embanked. If the water, instead of
being stored, is to be got rid of, as in drainage work,
the only information required as to discharges is the
maximum discharge. Large scale plans, sections, or
information as to silt or water-levels (except as a means
of estimating the discharge) will not be required unless
the stream is to be altered or embanked.</h3>

<p>In all these cases of small streams the information
required is generally, as has been seen, less than in the
case of large perennial streams, but it is generally more
difficult to obtain. If the stream is ill-defined or its
flow intermittent, especially if it is also very small and
the place sparsely inhabited, it may be difficult to obtain
any discharge figures except those based on figures of
rainfall. The method of obtaining such figures has been
stated in <span class="smcap"><a href="#CHAPTER_II">Chap. II.</a></span> The figures required are those of
the annual and monthly fall when the water is to be
stored, and those of the greatest fall in a short period
when the water is to be got rid of. Of course a plan
of the catchment area is required.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_7">7. <b>Intermittent Streams.</b>&mdash;In the case of large
streams whose flow is intermittent, the information
required will, as before, depend upon the circumstances.
Such streams occur in many countries. The difficulty
in obtaining information is often very great. To obtain
figures of daily discharge a gauge must be set up in the
stream and a register kept. The chief difficulty in an
out-of-the-way place is likely to be the obtaining
correct information as to the maximum discharge. Information,
derived from reports or from supposed flood
marks, as to the highest water-level, may be inaccurate,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
and information based on rainfall figures may be
extremely doubtful owing to the large size of the
catchment area, the absence of rain gauges, and the
difficulty, especially if the rain is not heavy, in
estimating the available fall. All sources of information
must be utilised and, whenever possible, observations
should be made over a long period of time.</h3>

<h3 id="Chap_III_Art_8">8. <b>Remarks.</b>&mdash;Very much remains to be done in
collecting and publishing information concerning the
ratio of the discharges to the rainfall. By observing a
fall of rain and the discharge of a stream before and
after the fall, it is possible to ascertain the figures for
that occasion, but they will not hold good for all
occasions. Continuous observations are required. The
chief obstacle is the expense. Not only have measuring
weirs and apparatus for automatically recording the
water-level to be provided, but the weirs would often
cause flooding of land involving payment of compensation.
The most suitable places for making
observations are those where reservoirs for water-works
exist or are about to be made.

<span class="large">THE SILTING AND SCOURING ACTION OF STREAMS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;When flowing water carries
solid substances in suspension, they are known as “silt.”
Material is also moved by being rolled along the bed
of the stream. The difference between silt and rolled
material is one of degree and not of kind. Material of
one kind may be rolled and carried alternately. The
quantity of silt present in each cubic foot of water is
called the “charge” of silt. Silt consists chiefly of mud
and fine sand; rolled material of sand, gravel, shingle,
and boulders. When a stream erodes its channel, it
is said to “scour.” When it deposits material in its
channel, it is said to “silt.” Both terms are used
irrespective of whether the material is silt or rolled
material. A stream of given velocity and depth can
carry only a certain charge of silt. When it is carrying
this it is said to be “fully charged.”</h3>

<p>If a stream has power to scour any particular material
from its channel, it has power to transport it; but the
converse is not true. If the material is hard or coherent,
the stream may have far more difficulty in eroding it
than in merely keeping it moving. And there is generally
a little more difficulty even when the material
is soft.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>Silting or scour may affect the bed of a channel or
the sides or both. The channel may thus decrease or
increase in width or&mdash;if one bank is affected more
than, or in a different manner to, the other&mdash;alter its
position laterally whether or not it is altering its bed
level, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>The cross-section of a stream is generally “shallow,”
<i>i.e.</i> the width of the bed is greater than the combined
submerged lengths of the sides, and the action on the
bed is generally greater than on the sides.</p>

<p>Silting and scouring are generally regular or irregular
in their action according as the flow is regular or
irregular, that is, according as the channel is free or
not from abrupt changes and eddies. In a uniform
canal fed from a river, the deposit in the head reach
of the canal forms a wedge-shaped mass, the depth of
the deposit decreasing with a fair approach to uniformity.
Salient angles or places alongside of obstructions are
most liable to scour, and deep hollows or recesses to
silt. Eddies have exceptionally strong scouring power.
Immediately downstream of an abrupt change scour
is often severe. An abrupt change is one, whether
of sectional area or direction of flow, and whether or
not accompanied by a junction or bifurcation, which is
so sudden as to cause eddies. The hole scoured alongside
of an obstruction may extend to its upstream side,
though there is generally little initial tendency to scour
there. An obstruction is anything causing an abrupt
decrease in any part of the cross-section of a stream,
whether or not there is a decrease in the whole cross-section,
<i>e.g.</i> a bridge pier or spur.</p>

<p>Most streams vary greatly at different times both in
volume and velocity and in the quantity of material
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
brought into them. Hence the action is not constant.
A stream may silt at one season and scour at another,
maintaining a steady average. When this happens
to a moderate extent, or when the stream never silts
or scours appreciably, it is said to be in “permanent
régime,” or “stable.” Most streams in earthen channels
are either just stable and no more, or are unstable.</p>

<p>Waves, whether due to wind or other agency, may
cause scour, especially of the banks. Their effect on
the bed becomes less as the depth of water increases,
but does not cease altogether at a depth of 21 feet,
as has been supposed. Salt water possesses a power of
causing mud, but not sand, to deposit.</p>

<p><i>Arts. 2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>6</i> of this chapter refer to action on
the bed of a stream. Action on the sides will be
considered in <i>Art. 7</i>.</p>

<p>Weeds usually grow only in water which has so low
a velocity that it carries no silt to speak of, but if any
silt is introduced the weeds cause a deposit. The weeds
also thrive on such a deposit.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_2">2. <b>Rolled Material.</b>&mdash;If a number of bodies have
similar shapes, and if D is the diameter of one of them
and V the velocity of the water relatively to it, the
rolling force is theoretically as V<sup>2</sup> D<sup>2</sup>, and the resisting
force or weight as D<sup>3</sup>. If these are just balanced, D
varies as V<sup>2</sup>, or the diameters of similarly shaped bodies
which can just be rolled are as V<sup>2</sup> and their weights as
V<sup>6</sup>. From practical observations, it seems that the
diameters do not vary quite so rapidly as they would
by the above law, the weights being more nearly as V<sup>5</sup>.</h3>

<p>Let a stream of pure water having a depth D, and
with boulders on its bed, have a velocity V just sufficient
to move them very slowly. Any larger boulders would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
not be moved. Any smaller boulders would move more
quickly. Similarly, fine sand would be rolled more
quickly than coarse sand. If the velocity of the stream
increases, larger boulders would be moved. Streams are
thus constantly sorting out the materials which they
roll. If the bed is examined it will be found that large
boulders exist only down to a certain point, smaller
boulders, shingle, gravel, coarse sand and fine sand
following in succession.</p>

<p>If the water, instead of being pure, is supposed to
contain silt, this may affect its velocity&mdash;it is not, however,
known to do so&mdash;but, given a certain velocity, it
is not likely that the rolling power of the stream is
much affected by its containing silt.</p>

<p>It is sometimes supposed that increased depth gives
increased rolling power, because of the increased pressure,
but this is not so. The increased pressure due to depth
acts on both the upstream and downstream sides of a
body. It is moved only by the pressure due to the
velocity.</p>

<p>When sand is rolled along the bed of a stream there
is usually a succession of abrupt falls in the bed. After
each fall there is a long gentle upward slope till the
next fall is reached. The sand is rolled up the long
slope and falls over the steep one. It soon becomes
buried. The positions of the falls of course keep moving
downstream. The height of a fall in a large channel is
perhaps 6 inches or 1 foot, and the distance between
the falls 20 or 30 feet. A fall does not usually extend
straight across the bed but zigzags.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been said that the inclination of the
bed of a stream, when high, facilitates scour, the material
rolling more easily down a steep inclined plane. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
inclination is nearly always too small to have any
appreciable direct effect. The inclination of the surface
of the stream of course affects its velocity, and this is
the chief factor in the case.</p>

<p>A sudden rise in the bed of a stream does not necessarily
cause rolled materials to accumulate there, except
perhaps to the extent necessary to form a gentle slope.
Frequently even this slope is not formed, especially if
the rolled material is only sand. The eddies stir it
up and it is carried on. The above remarks apply also
to weirs or other local rises in the bed.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_3">3. <b>Materials carried in Suspension.</b>&mdash;It has long
been known that the scouring and transporting power
of a stream increases with its velocity. Observations
made by Kennedy have shown that its power to carry
silt decreases as the depth of water increases (<i>Min.
Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. cxix.). The power is probably
derived from the eddies which are produced at the bed.
Every suspended particle tends to sink, if its specific
gravity is greater than unity. It is prevented from
sinking by the upward components of the eddies. If V
is the velocity of the stream and D its depth, the force
exerted by the eddies generated on 1 square foot of the
bed is greater as the velocity is greater, and is probably
as V<sup>2</sup> or thereabouts. But, given the charge of silt, the
weight of silt in a vertical column of water whose base
is 1 square foot is as D. Therefore the power of a
stream to support silt is as V<sup>2</sup> and inversely as D. The
silt charge which a stream of depth D can carry is as
V<sup>½</sup>. V is called the “critical velocity” for that depth,
and is designated as V<sub>0</sub>.</h3>

<p>The full charge must be affected by the nature of the
silt. The specific gravity of fine mud is not much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
greater than that of water, while that of sand is about
1·5 times as great. Moreover, the particles of sand are
far larger than the particles of mud. If two streams of
equal depths and velocities are fully charged, one with
particles of mud and the other with particles of sand,
the latter will sink more rapidly and will have to be
more frequently thrown up. They will be fewer in
number. From some observations referred to by Kennedy
(<i>Punjab Irrigation Paper</i>, No. 9, “Silt and Scour
in the Sirhind Canal,” 1904), it appears that in a fully
charged stream which carried 1/3300 of its volume of a
mixture of mud and sand of various grades, sand of a
particular degree of coarseness formed only 1/35,000 of the
volume of the water, but that when the same stream
was clear and was turned on to a bed of the coarse
sand it took up 1/15,000 of its volume. It would thus
appear that the full charge of silt is less as its coarseness
and heaviness are greater. This is in accordance
with the laws mentioned above (<i>Art. 2</i>, par. 1). See
also <a href="#Chap_V_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>, last paragraph.</p>

<p>It is probable that fine mud is carried almost equally
into all parts of the stream, whereas sand is nearly
always found in greater proportion near the bed and,
as before remarked, some materials may be rolled and
suspended alternately. The charge of mixed silt which
a stream can carry is, no doubt, something between
the charge which it can carry of each kind separately,
but the laws of this part of the subject are not yet
fully known. From the observations above referred to,
Kennedy concludes that a canal with velocity V<sub>0</sub> will
carry in suspension 1/3300 to 1/5000 of its volume of silt,
according as it is charged with sand of all classes or
only with the heavier classes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>Let a stream be carrying a full charge of any kind
of silt. Then if there is any reduction in velocity,
a deposit will occur&mdash;unless there is also a reduction
of depth&mdash;until the charge of silt is reduced again to
the full charge for the stream. The deposit generally
occurs slowly, and extends over a considerable length
of channel. The heavier materials are, of course,
deposited first. If a stream is not fully charged, it
tends to become so by scouring its channel. It is
generally believed that a stream fully charged with silt
cannot scour silt from its channel, or bear any introduction
of further silt. This seems to be correct in the
main, but the remarks made in the latter part of the
preceding paragraph must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>It has been stated (<i>Art. 2</i>) that a weir or a sudden
rise in the bed does not necessarily cause an accumulation
of rolled material. It never causes a deposit of
suspended material unless it causes a heading up and
reduction of velocity to below the critical velocity.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_4">4. <b>Methods of Investigation.</b>&mdash;The quantity of
silt in water is found by taking specimens of the water
and evaporating it or, if the silt is present in great
quantity, leaving it to settle for twelve hours&mdash;an
ounce of alum can be added for every 10 cubic feet of
water to accelerate settlement&mdash;drawing off the water
by a syphon, and heating the deposit to dry it. The
deposit is then measured or weighed. It is best to
weigh it. If clay is filled into a measure, the volume
depends greatly on the manner in which it is filled in.
When silt deposits in large quantities in a channel, or
when heavy scour occurs, the volume deposited or
scoured is ascertained by taking careful sections of
the channel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_1" src="images/fig_1.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span></p></div>

<p>Silt is best classified by observing its rate of fall
through still water. A sand which falls at ·10 feet
per second is, in India, called class (·1), and mixed sand
which falls at rates varying from ·1 to ·2 feet per
second is called class ·1/·2. Fig. 1 shows a sand separator
designed by Kennedy. The scale is ⅛. It has a syphon
action, and the rate of flow can be altered by altering
the length of the exit pipe. Suppose it is desired to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
measure the sand of class (·10) and all heavier kinds.
The pipe is adjusted so as to give a velocity of ·1 foot
per second to the upward flowing water, which then
carries off all silt of class (·10) or finer. All heavier silt
falls into the glass tube. It can be separated again by
being mixed with water and passed through the
instrument again, the velocity of flow through the
instrument being increased.</p>

<p>The quantity of silt present at various depths can be
found by pumping specimens of water through pipes.
At each change of depth the pipe, delivery hose, etc.,
should be cleaned. Allowance must be made for the
velocity of ascent of the water up the pipe. Suppose
this to be 1·4 feet per second. Then the velocity of
sand of class (·2) would be 1·2 feet per second, and the
quantity of sand actually found in the water would
have to be increased by one-sixth.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_5">5. <b>Quantity and Distribution of Silt.</b>&mdash;The
quantity of silt present in water varies enormously.
Fine mud, even though sufficient to discolour the water,
may be so small in volume that it only deposits when
the water is still, and even then deposits slowly. In the
river Tay, near Perth, the silt was found to be ordinarily
1/10,000 of the volume of water, and at low water only
1/28,000. In the river Sutlej at Rupar, near where it issues
from the Himalayas, the silt in the flood season is
extremely heavy. Out of 360 observations, made at
various depths, during the flood seasons of four successive
years, in water whose depth ranged up to 12 feet, the
silt was once found to be 2·1 per cent. by weight of
that of the water. It was more than 1·2 per cent. on
four occasions, and more than 0·3 per cent. (or 3 in
1000) on sixty-four occasions. Generally about one-half
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
of the silt was clay and sand of classes finer than (·10),
about one-third was sand of class ·1/·2, and the residue was
sand of class ·2/·3. The sand of the river Chenab is
generally coarser than that of the Sutlej. There are
very great differences in the degree of coarseness of
river sand. The sand in any river becomes finer and
finer as the gradient flattens in approaching the sea.
Sea sand has been found to be of class (·20). In the
Sirhind Canal, which takes out from the Sutlej at Rupar,
the maximum quantity of suspended silt observed in
the four flood seasons was 0·7 per cent., on one occasion
out of 270, and it exceeded 0·3 per cent. on twenty-five
occasions. About 80 per cent. of the silt was clay.</h3>

<p>In another part of the paper quoted, it is stated that
the silt suspended in the canal water averaged, during
the whole of one flood season, about 1/1700 of the volume
of the water. This would be about 1/1200 by weight.
The silt deposited in the bed of the canal, in a period of
a few days, was sometimes as much as 1/1000 of the
water which had passed along, and occasionally as much as
1/500. It was nearly all sand, only about 3 per cent.
being clay. Silt of classes finer than (·1) gave no trouble,
and were to be eliminated in future investigations. In
a canal, as in a river, the sand on the bed becomes finer
the further from the head.</p>

<p>Regarding the distribution of the silt at various
depths, in water 5 to 17 feet deep, the quantity of silt
near the bed may, when the charge is heavy and
consists of mixed silt, be 1¼ to 3 times that at the
surface. If the charge is fine mud, there is likely to
be as much silt at the surface as near the bed, if sand,
there may be none at the surface and little in the upper
part of the stream.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>In all cases single observations are likely to show
extraordinarily discordant results; a number of observations
must be made at each point and averaged.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_6">6. <b>Practical Formulæ and Figures.</b>&mdash;A stream
which carries silt generally rolls materials along its bed.
The proportion between the quantities of material
rolled and carried is never known, and this makes it
impossible to frame an exact formula applicable to such
cases, but Kennedy, from his observations on canals
fully charged with the heavy silt and fine sand usually
found in Indian rivers near the hills, arrived at the
empirical formula for critical velocities

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">V = ·84 D<sup>·64</sup><br /></span>
</span></span>

The observations were made on the Bari Doab Canal
and its branches, the widths of the channels varying
from 8 feet to 91 feet, and the depths of water from
2·3 feet to 7·3 feet. The beds of these channels have,
in the course of years, adjusted themselves by silting or
scouring, so that there is a state of permanent régime,
each stream carrying its full charge of silt, and the
charges in all being about equal. From further observations
referred to above (<i>Art. 3</i>, par. 2) it appears
that this kind of silt forms about 1/3300 of the volume of
the water, and that on the Sirhind Canal, sand coarser
than the (·10) class, formed 1/35,000 of the volume of
water.</h3>

<p>The formula gives the following critical velocities for
various depths:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>In Indian rivers not near the hills the silt carried is
not so heavy, and the critical velocities are supposed to
be about three-fourths of the above. Thrupp (<i>Min.
Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. clxxi.) gives the following ranges
of velocities as those which will enable streams to
carry different kinds of silt. It does not appear that
the streams would be fully charged except at the higher
figure given for each case.</p>

<table class="rainfall">
  <tr>
    <td>D = 1·0</td>
    <td>10·0</td>

<p>It cannot be said that the exact relations between D
and V are yet known, but it is of great practical
importance to know that V must vary with D. The
precise manner in which it must vary does not, for
moderate changes, make very much difference. In
designing a channel a suitable relation of depth to
velocity can be arranged for, and one quantity or the
other kept in the ascendant, according as scouring or
silting is the evil to be guarded against.</p>

<p>The old idea was that an increase in V, even if
accompanied by an increase in D, <i>e.g.</i> simply running
a higher supply in a given channel, gave increased silt-transporting
power. In a stream of very shallow
section this is probably correct, for V increases faster
than D<sup>·64</sup> (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i>). In a stream
of deep section a decrease in D gives increased silt-transporting
power. If the discharge is fixed, a change
in the depth or width must be met by a change of the
opposite kind in the other quantity. In this case
widening or narrowing the channel may be proper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
according to circumstances. In a deep section widening
will decrease the depth of water, and may also increase
the velocity, and it will thus give increased scouring
power. In a shallow section, narrowing will increase
the velocity more than it increases D<sup>·64</sup>. In a medium
section it is a matter of exact calculation to find out
whether widening or narrowing will improve matters.</p>

<p>If the water entering a channel has a higher silt-charge
than can be carried in the channel, some of it
must deposit. Suppose an increased discharge to be
run, and that this gives a higher silt-carrying power
and a smaller rate of deposit per cubic foot of discharge,
it does not follow that the deposit will be less. The
quantity of silt entering the channel is now greater
than before. Owing to want of knowledge regarding
the proportions of silt and rolled material, and to
want of exactness in the formulæ, reliable calculations
regarding proportions deposited cannot be made.</p>

<p>The channels in which the observations above referred
to were made have all assumed nearly rectangular cross-sections,
the sides having become vertical by the deposit
on them of finer silt; but the formula probably applies
approximately to any channel if D is the mean depth
from side to side, and V the mean velocity in the whole
section.</p>

<p>If the ratio of V to D differs in different parts of a
cross-section, there is a tendency towards deposit in the
parts where the ratio is least, or to scour where it is
greatest. There is a tendency for the silt-charge to
adjust itself, that is, to become less where the above
ratio is less, but the irregular movements of the stream
cause a transference of water among all parts, and this
tends to equalise the silt-charge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Dubuat gives the following as the velocities close to
the bed which will enable a stream to scour or roll
various materials. The bed velocity is probably less
than the mean velocity in the ratio of about ·6 to 1 in
rough channels, and about ·7 to 1 in smooth channels:&mdash;</p>

<p>The figures for brick, earthenware, and rock can apply
only to materials of exceedingly poor quality. Masonry
of good hard stone will stand 20 feet per second, and
instances have occurred in which brickwork has withstood
a velocity of 90 feet per second without injury so
long as the water did not carry sand and merely flowed
along the brickwork. If there are abrupt changes in
the stream, causing eddies, or if there is impact and
shock, or if sand, gravel, shingle, or boulders are liable
to be carried along, velocities must be limited.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_7">7. <b>Action on the Sides of a Channel.</b>&mdash;It has been
seen that the laws of silting and scour on the bed of a
channel depend on the ratio of the depth to the velocity.
The same laws probably hold good in the case of a
gently shelving bank, so that here again V ought to
vary as D<sup>·64</sup>. The velocity near the angle where the
slope meets the water surface seems to decrease faster
than D<sup>·64</sup>. At all events, silt tends to deposit in the
angle and the slope to become steep.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></h3>

<p>When the slope is steep the law seems to be different,
the tendency for deposit or scour to occur on the bank
depending on the actual velocity without much relation
to the depth. The velocity very near to a steep bank
is always low relatively to that in the rest of the stream.
Thus there is often a tendency for silt to deposit on the
bank, especially in the upper part, and for the side to
become vertical except for a slight rounding at the lower
corner. A bank may receive deposits when the bed
may be receiving none, and it may have a persistent
tendency to grow out towards the stream. The growth
of the bank is generally regular, the line of the bank
being preserved, but it may be irregular, especially if
vegetation, other than small grass, becomes established
on the new deposits.</p>

<p>When scour of the sides of a channel occurs it may
occur by direct action of the stream on the sides near
the water-level, or by action at or near the toe of the
slope, which causes the upper part of the bank to fall in.
Such falling in is generally more or less irregular, and
the bank presents an uneven appearance. The fallen
pieces of bank may remain, more or less intact, especially
if they are held together by the roots of grasses, etc.,
where they fell, and prevent further scour occurring along
the toe of the slope. Falling in of banks is most liable
to occur in large streams and with light soils. It may
be caused by the waves which are produced by steamers
and boats or, especially in broad streams, by wind. The
action on the banks at bends is discussed in <i>Art. 8</i>.</p>

<p>Thus in designing a channel according to the
principles laid down in <i>Art. 6</i>, the question of action on
the sides of the channel has to be dealt with as follows.
Whether or not the velocity is to be low, relatively to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
the depth, <i>i.e.</i> whether or not deposit on the bed is
more likely to occur than scour, care can be taken not
to make it actually too low, and not to make it actually
too high, particularly if the soil is light and friable.
With ordinary soils a mean velocity of 3·3 feet per
second in the channel is generally safe as regards scour
of the sides. Any velocity of more than 3·5 feet per
second may give trouble. A velocity of less than 1 foot
per second is likely to give rise to deposit on the sides.</p>

<p>In channels in alluvial soils the falling in of banks is
sometimes said to occur more when the stream is falling
than at other times. This has been noticed on both
the Mississippi and the Indus. The cause has been said
to be the draining out of water which had percolated
into the bank, the water in flowing out carrying some
sand with it. The effect of this cannot however be
great.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_8">8. <b>Action at Bends.</b>&mdash;At a bend, owing to the
action of centrifugal force and to cross-currents caused
thereby, there is a deposit near the convex bank and a
corresponding deepening&mdash;unless the bed is too hard to
be scoured&mdash;near the concave bank. The water-level
at the concave bank is slightly higher than at the
convex bank. The greatest velocity instead of being
in mid-stream is nearer the concave bank.</h3>

<p>As the transverse current and transverse surface slope
cannot commence or end abruptly, there is a certain
length in which they vary. In this length the radius
of curvature of the bend and the form of the cross-section
also tend to vary. This can often be seen in
plans of river bends, the curvature being less sharp
towards the ends.</p>

<p>When once a stream has assumed a curved form, be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
it ever so slight, the tendency is for the bend to
increase. The greater velocity and greater depth near
the concave bank react on each other, each inducing
the other. The concave bank is worn away, or
becoming vertical by erosion near the bed, cracks, falls
in, and is washed away, a deposit of silt occurring at
the convex bank, so that the width of the stream
remains tolerably constant. The bend may go on increasing,
and it often tends to move downstream.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_2" src="images/fig_2.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span></p></div>

<p>In <a href="#fig_2">fig. 2</a> the deep places are shown by dotted lines.
Along the straight dotted line there is no deep place.
Such a line would be used for a ford. At low water it
becomes a shoal. This is the chief reason why a
tortuous stream at low water consists of alternate pools
and rapids. It is sometimes said that deep water
occurs near to a steep hard bank. Such deepening is
due to bends or obstructions which give the current a
set towards the bank, or it is due to irregularities in the
bank which cause eddies. In a straight channel with
even and regular banks there is no such deepening.</p>

<p>When a bend has formed in a channel previously
straight, the stream at the lower end of the bend, by
setting against the opposite bank, tends to cause
another bend of the opposite kind to the first. Thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
the tendency is for the stream to become tortuous and,
while the tortuosity is slight, the length, and therefore
the slope and velocity, are little affected; but the action
may continue until the increase in the length of the
stream materially flattens the slope, and the consequent
reduction in velocity causes erosion to cease. Or the
stream during a flood may find, along the chord of a
bend, a direct route with, of course, a steeper slope.
Scouring a channel along this route it straightens itself,
and its action then commences afresh. Short cuts of
this kind do not, however, occur so frequently as is
sometimes believed. In some streams the bends acquire
a horse-shoe shape and the neck becomes very narrow
and short cuts may then occur. Otherwise they are
not common. V increases only as √(S), and if the
country is covered with vegetation it is not easy for a
stream to scour out a new channel.</p>

<p>The effect of bends on the velocity of a stream is not
well understood. In case of a bend of 90° the increased
resistance to flow when the bend is absolutely sudden (a
sudden bend is known as an “elbow”) amounts perhaps
to V<sup>2</sup>/(2<i>g</i>). Whether it is greater or less in the case of a
gentle bend of 90° is not known. In the case of a pipe
there is a certain radius which gives a minimum resistance
(<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>). The increased resistance
at a bend is due partly to the fact that the maximum
velocity is no longer in the centre of the stream, and
partly to the fact that the velocities at the different
parts of the cross-section have to be rearranged at the
commencement of the bend and again at its termination.
Thus the effect of a bend of 45° is a good deal
more than half of that of a bend of 90°. Two bends of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
45°, both in the same direction, with a straight reach
between them, will cause more resistance than a single
bend of 90° with the straight reach above or below
the bend. If the two bends of 45° are in different
directions the resistance will be still greater. A succession
of sharp bends may produce a serious effect,
amounting to an increase in roughness of the channel.
A succession of gentle bends, of any considerable angle,
cannot of course occur within a moderate length of
channel.</p>

<p>When there is head to spare there is clearly no objection
to bends, except that the bank may need protection.
At a place where the bank has in any case to be protected,
<i>e.g.</i> at a weir, there is no objection to an elbow.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IV_Art_9">9. <b>General Tendencies of Streams.</b>&mdash;Since the
velocity is greater as the area of the cross-section is
less, a stream always tends to scour where narrow or
shallow, and to silt where wide or deep. The cross-section
thus tends to become uniform in size. Suppose
two cross-sections to be equal in size but different in
shape. The velocities of the two sections will be equal.
The tendency of the bed to silt will (<i>Art. 6</i>) be greater
at the deeper section and, when silting has occurred on
the bed, the section will be reduced and there will be a
tendency to scour at the sides. Thus the cross-sections
tend to become also uniform in shape. If a bank of
silt has formed in a stream, the tendency is for scour
to occur. There is also a tendency for silt to deposit
just below the point where the bank ends. Hence a
silt bank often moves downstream.</h3>

<p>Owing to the tendency to scour alongside of, or
downstream of, obstructions (<i>Art. 1</i>), it is clear that a
stream constantly tends to destroy obstructions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>There is an obvious tendency for silt to deposit where
the bed slope of a stream flattens, and for scour to take
place where it steepens (<i>Hydraulics</i>, figs. 16 and 17,
pp. 24 and 25), and thus the tendency is for the slope
to become uniform.</p>

<p>In a natural stream flowing from hilly country to
a lake or sea, the slope is steepest at the commencement
and gradually flattens. There is thus a tendency for
the bed to rise except at the mouth of the stream. This
rising tends to increase the slope and velocity in the
lower reaches, and this again enhances the tendency,
described in the preceding article, of the stream to
increase in tortuosity.</p>

<p>When a silt-bearing stream overflows its banks the
depth of water on the flooded bank is probably small
and its velocity very low, and a deposit of silt takes
place on the bank. When the deposit has reached a
certain height it acts like a weir on the water of the
next flood, which flows quickly over it and, instead of
raising it higher, deposits its silt further away from the
stream. In this way a strip of country along the stream
gradually becomes raised, the raising being greatest
close to the stream. The country slopes downwards
in going away from the stream. In other words, the
stream runs on a ridge. If the bank becomes raised
so high that flooding no longer occurs, the raising
action ceases, but if, as is likely in alluvial country,
the bed of the stream also rises, the action may continue
and the ridge become very pronounced.</p>

<p>Some rivers have very wide and soft channels which
are only filled from bank to bank in floods, if then. The
deep stream winds about in the channel, and the rest
of it is occupied by sandbanks and minor arms. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
winding is the result of the velocity being too great for
the channel. The streams, especially the main stream,
constantly shift their courses by scouring one bank or
the other. Now and then the main stream takes a
short cut, either down a minor arm or across an easily
eroded sandbank. This is a very different matter from
a short cut across high ground. The sandbanks receive
deposits of silt in floods, but are constantly being cut
away at the sides. Such rivers frequently erode their
banks to an extraordinary extent. The Indus sometimes
cuts into its bank 100 feet or more in a day, and it may
cut for half a mile or more without cessation. The
tortuosity of such a stream increases as it gets nearer
the sea. The actual length of the Indus in the 400
miles nearest the sea is 39 per cent. greater than its
course measured along the bank. In the reach from
the 600th to the 700th mile from the sea, the difference
is only 3 per cent. For a detailed description of some
such rivers, see <i>Punjab Rivers and Works</i>.</p>

<p>Sometimes general statements are made regarding
silting or scour in connection, for instance, with a stream
which is confined between embankments or training
walls, or has overflowed its banks or is held up by a
weir. It is impossible to say that any such condition,
or any condition, will cause silting or scour, unless the
velocity depth and silt charge are known.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="large">METHODS OF INCREASING OR REDUCING SILTING
OR SCOUR</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_V_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;Most important works
which affect the régime of a stream have some effect on
its silting or scouring action, but this is not generally
their chief object. Such works will be dealt with in
due course, and the effects which they are likely to
produce on silting or scouring will be mentioned. In
the present chapter only those works and measures will
be considered whose chief object is to cause a stream to
alter its silting or scouring action. It does not matter,
so far as this discussion is concerned, whether the object
is direct, <i>i.e.</i> concerned only with the particular place
where the effect is to be produced, or indirect, as, for
instance, where a stream is made to scour in order that
it may deposit material further down the stream. The
protection of banks from scour is considered in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI"><span class="smcap">Chap.
VI.</span></a> Dredging is dealt with in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII"><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span></a></h3>

<h3 id="Chap_V_Art_2">2. <b>Production of Scour or Reduction of Silting.</b>&mdash;Sometimes
the silt on the bed of a stream is artificially
stirred up by simple measures, as, for instance, by scrapers
or harrows attached to boats which are allowed to drift
with the stream, or by means of a cylinder which has
claw-like teeth projecting from its circumference and is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
rolled along the bed, or by fitting up boats with shutters
which are let down close to the bed and so cause a rush
of water under them, or by anchoring a steamer and
working its screw propeller. It is thus possible to
cause a great deal of local scour, but the silt tends to
deposit again quickly, and it is not easy to keep any
considerable length of channel permanently scoured.
The system is suitable in a case in which a local shallow
or sandbank is to be got rid of and deposit of silt a
little further down is not objectionable. It may be
suitable in a case in which the bed is to be scoured
while a deposit of silt at the sides of the channel is
required, especially if some arrangement to encourage
silt deposit at the sides is used (<i>Art. 3</i>, par. 4; also
<a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>).</h3>

<p>Holding back the water by means, for instance, of
a regulator or movable weir, and letting it in again
with somewhat of a rush, will, if frequently repeated,
have some effect in moving silt on in the downstream
reach. Regarding the upstream reach, it has
been remarked (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>) that a weir does not
necessarily cause silt deposit. If, in a stream which
does not ordinarily silt, a regulator or movable weir
causes, when the water is headed up, some silt deposit,
the cessation of the heading up not only removes the
tendency to silt, but the section of the stream, at the
place where the deposit occurred, is less than elsewhere,
and there is thus a tendency to scour there. If a
regulator is alternately closed and opened, no permanent
deposit of much consequence is likely to occur.</p>

<p>A stream may be made to scour its channel by opening
an escape or branch. This causes a draw in the stream,
and an increase in velocity for a long distance upstream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
of the bifurcation (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i>).
This procedure is sometimes adopted on irrigation
canals. The escape is generally opened in order to
reduce the quantity of water passing down, but it may
be opened solely to induce scour or prevent silting.
The floor of the escape head is usually higher than the
bed of the canal, but this does not interfere with operations
except at low supplies. It may (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art.
2</i></a>) have some effect on the quantity of rolled material
passed out of the escape.</p>

<p>If there is a weir in the river below the off-take of
the canal, and if the escape runs back to the river and
thus has a good fall, the scouring action in the canal
may be very powerful.</p>

<p>If the main channel has a uniform slope throughout,
the slope of its water surface is greater upstream of the
escape than downstream of the escape, and there is thus
an abrupt reduction of velocity and possibly a deposit
of silt in the main channel below the escape. This may
or may not be objectionable. In the case of an irrigation
canal, it is far less objectionable than deposit in the
head of the canal. The best point for the off-take of
any escape or scouring channel depends on the position
of the deposits in the main channel. The off-take
should be downstream of the chief deposits, but as near
to all of them as possible. A breach in a bank acts of
course in the same way as an escape.</p>

<p>A stream of clear water when sent down a channel
will scour it if the material is sufficiently soft. In the
case of the Sirhind Canal, it has already been mentioned
(<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>), that when the river water became
clear after the floods the proportion of coarse sand, <i>i.e.</i>
sand above the (·10) class, carried by the canal water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
was about 1/15,000 by volume. This was in the period
from 22nd September to 7th October. From 8th to 23rd
October the proportion averaged 1/32,000 from 24th
October to 8th November 1/44,000, and from 9th to 24th
November 1/85,000. The reason of this reduction was
that the comparatively clear water kept picking up the
sand from the bed and moving it on, the finer kinds
being moved most quickly. As the coarse sand left on
the bed became less in quantity, the water took up less.
It appears, however, that the water also picked up some
clay which was left, and that the total suspended silt in
November was 1/9000 of the water. All the observations
mentioned in this paragraph appear to have been made
at Garhi, 26 miles from the head of the canal.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_V_Art_3">3. <b>Production of Silt Deposit.</b>&mdash;Works or measures
for causing silt deposit may be undertaken in order
to cause silt deposit in specific places where it will be
useful, or in order to free the water from silt. Sometimes
both objects are combined.</h3>

<p>If a stream can be turned into a large pond or low
ground&mdash;a bank being built round it if necessary&mdash;it can
be made to part with some or all of its silt whether
rolled or suspended. Even if the pond is so large that
the velocity becomes imperceptible, the whole of the
suspended matter will not deposit unless it has sufficient
time, but the matter which remains in the water is likely
to be extremely small in amount. The silting up of
marshes, pools, borrow-pits, etc., is now being effected,
or should be effected, in places where mosquitoes and
malaria are prevalent.</p>

<p>In the upper or torrential part of a stream, a high
dam, provided with a sluice and a high-level waste
weir, may be built across it. The space above the dam
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
becomes more or less filled with gravel, etc. This has
been done in Switzerland (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>,
vol. clxxi.). In the U.S.A. long weirs have been
built in order to stop the progress of detritus from
gold mines. Such detritus was liable to choke up
rivers and damage the adjoining lands. The detritus
from hill torrents can also be reduced by afforestation
of the hill sides.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p></div>

<p>When a stream is in embankment&mdash;irrigation channels
are frequently so&mdash;the bank can be set back (<a href="#fig_3">fig. 3</a>),
and suspended silt will then deposit on the berms. The
object of this arrangement is generally to create very
strong banks in low ground. A similar plan can be
adopted when the berm is only slightly below the
water-level and even when it is only occasionally
submerged. In this case the deposit of a small bank
of silt along the edge of the berm next the stream
will prevent the access of fresh supplies of silt-bearing
water to the parts further away. Gaps should be cut
in the bank of silt at intervals, and cross banks made
to form “silting tanks,” as shown in <a href="#fig_4">fig. 4</a>. The inlets
to the tank should be large, and the outlets small, so
that the water in the tank may have little velocity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
It is not, however, correct to have the outlet so small&mdash;unless
the water contain very little silt&mdash;that there is
very little flow through the tank. The tanks will
generally be silted up most quickly by allowing a good
flow through them, even though only a small proportion
of the silt in the water is deposited. Regular banks
arranged to form tanks on the above principle can be
made behind the original banks of a canal in cases
where the original banks were not, for any reason, set
back.</p>

<p>When a channel is made in low ground and the
excavation is not sufficient to make the banks, borrow-pits
can be dug in the bed of the channel. Such pits
should not be long and continuous, but wide bars should
be left so that a number of short pits will result.
These pits will trap rolled material as well as suspended
silt. The object in this case is to free the water from
silt and to reduce the size of the channel and thus
reduce the loss of water from percolation.</p>

<p>On the Indus, where it has a strong tendency to shift
westwards, long earthen dams or groynes are run out
from the west bank across the sandbanks. One object
is to cause silt deposit, and so increase the quantity of
material which the river will have to cut away, but
whether this result is achieved is doubtful. The sandbanks
receive deposits in any case. A groyne may
increase the deposit on its upstream side, but it cuts
off the flood water from its downstream side and so
reduces the deposit there.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_V_Art_4">4. <b>Arrangements at Bifurcations.</b>&mdash;At a bifurcation,
as where a branch takes off from a canal, it is
possible to reduce the quantity of rolled material
entering the canal by raising its bed or constructing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
a weir or “sill” in its head. This arrangement may
have great effect in excluding boulders, shingle, or
gravel. As regards rolled sand, it has much less effect
than might be expected (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>). If the
canal is reduced in width (<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>) there will be eddies
below the bed level of the branch. They will stir up
the sand and some of it will enter the branch. If the
canal is not reduced in width, eddies will be produced
in the surface water, and they will affect the bed.</h3>

<p>The above remarks apply also to the case of a canal
taken off from a river when there are no works in the
river.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_V_Art_5">5. <b>A Canal with Headworks in a River.</b>&mdash;In the
case of a canal taking off from a river and provided
with complete headworks, it is possible to do a great
deal more. The case of the Sirhind Canal, already
referred to (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_5"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Arts. 5</i></a> and <a href="#Chap_IV_Art_6"><i>6</i></a>), is a notable
example. The canal (<a href="#fig_6">fig. 6</a>) is more than 200 feet
wide, the full depth of water 10 feet, and the full discharge
about 7000 cubic feet per second. In 1893
when the irrigation had developed, and it became
necessary to run high supplies in the summer&mdash;July,
August, and part of September&mdash;the increase in the silt
deposit threatened to stop the working of the canal.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
In the autumn and winter, say from 25th September
to 15th March, the water entering the canal is clear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
and much of the deposit was picked up by it, but not
all. In the five years 1893 to 1897 inclusive, the
following remedial measures were adopted. Increased
use was made of the escape at the twelfth mile. This
did some good, but there was seldom water to spare.
In 1893 to 1894 the sill of the regulator was raised to 7
feet above the canal bed, and it was possible to raise
it 3 feet more by means of shutters. This had little
effect. The coarsest class of sand was ·4, and the velocity
of the water, even of that part of it which came up
from the river bed and passed over the sill, was over
2 feet per second, so that all sand was carried over.
In 1894 to 1895 the divide wall, which had been only
59 feet long, was lengthened to 710 feet, so as to make
a pond between the divide wall and the regulator,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>
but probably the leakage through the under-sluices
was often as much as the canal supply, and the water
in the pond was thus kept in rapid movement and full
of silt. The canal was closed in heavy floods. This
did some good, but probably the canal was often closed
needlessly when the water looked muddy but contained
no excessive quantity of sand. The above comments
on the measures taken were made by Mr Kennedy when
chief engineer. The above measures did not reduce
the silt deposits, but the scour in the clear water season
improved, probably because higher supplies were run
owing to increased irrigation. The deposit in the upper
reaches of the canal, when at its maximum about the
end of August of each year, was generally more than
twenty million cubic feet. From the year 1900 a
better system of regulation was enforced, the under-sluices
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
being kept closed as much as possible, so that
there was much less movement in the pond and much
less silt in its water. By 1904 the deposit in the canal
had been reduced to three million cubic feet, and no
further trouble occurred.</h3>

<p>During the period from 20th September 1908 to 10th
October 1908 the quantity of silt in the canal above
Chamkour (twelfth mile) decreased from 19,325,800
cubic feet to 12,477,600 cubic feet. The quantity
scoured away was 6,848,200 cubic feet. During this
period no silt entered the canal. The quantity which
passed out of the reach in question in suspension was
4,183,660 cubic feet, so that 2,664,540 cubic feet of
material must have been rolled along the bed.
The rolled material was 64 per cent. of the suspended
material. During this period the Daher escape, in
the twelfth mile, was open, and the mean velocity
in the canal just above the escape was about 4 feet
per second, the depth of water being about 10 feet.
The velocity near the escape was thus greater than
the critical velocity for mixed silt (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>),
and even a long way up the canal it would be in
excess of the critical velocity. The water seems to have
carried about 1/1800 of its volume of silt. Whether the
above proportions of rolled to suspended matter would
hold good in a fully charged stream flowing with the
critical velocity it is not easy to say.</p>

<p>As silt deposits in the pond, the velocity of the water
in it, along the course of the main current towards the
canal, increases and eventually the water begins to
carry coarse sand dangerous for the canal. In order to
ascertain when this state of affairs has been reached, two
methods of procedure are possible. One is to frequently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
test specimens of the water in the pond along the course
of the main current and see when it contains more
than 1/15,000 of its volume of coarse sand. This plan
would be troublesome and liable to error, and is rejected
by Kennedy, who suggests that the depth and velocity
of the water in the pond be frequently observed along
the course of the main current. As soon as the velocity
exceeds the critical velocity for mixed silt, it is time to
close the canal and open the under-sluices and scour
out the deposit from the pond. The period in which
most silt is believed to have been deposited in the canal
is the spring and early summer, say from 15th March
to 1st July. This is the time when the snows are
melting and the river water is clear. It can then carry
more sand than in the rains&mdash;1st July to 15th
September,&mdash;when it is muddy.</p>

<p>Kennedy also suggests that some under-sluices should
be provided at the far side of the river, <i>i.e.</i> at the right-hand
side of the weir. It would then be possible, by
opening them, to let floods pass without interfering
with the pond.</p>

<p>The two spurs or groynes, shown in the plan, were
constructed in 1897 so as to cause the stream to flow
along the face of the canal regulator and not allow
deposits to accumulate there. The depth of silt
deposited in a great part of the pond amounted at times
to 8 or 10 feet.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_V_Art_6">6. <b>Protection of the Bed.</b>&mdash;It is possible to afford
direct protection from scour to the bed of a stream by
constructing walls across it, but unless the walls are
near together the protection will not be effective. An
arrangement used in some streams in Switzerland consists
of tree trunks secured by short piles and resting on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
brushwood. But as long as the walls are not raised
above the bed they cannot entirely stop scour, unless
extremely close together. If raised above the bed they
form a series of weirs.</h3>

<p>The weirs must be so designed that the depth of
water in a reach between two weirs is great enough to
reduce the velocity down to the critical velocity, or less.
The fall in the water surface at each weir being very
small, the discharge over the weir can be found by considering
it as an orifice extending up to the downstream
water surface, and the head being the fall in the surface
at the weir.</p>

<p>To stop scour of the bed by direct protection without
raising the water-level, the bed can be paved, a plan
adopted in artificial channels with very high velocities.
The paving can be of stones, bricks, or concrete blocks.
The Villa system of protection, which has been used in
Italy, France, and Spain, consists of a flexible covering
laid on the bed. Prisms of burnt clay or cement are
strung on several parallel galvanized iron wires, which
are attached to cross-bars so as to form a grid a few
feet square. The grids are loosely connected to one
another at the corners, and the whole covering adjusts
itself to the irregularities of the bed (<i>Min. Proc. Inst.
C.E.</i>, vol. cxlvii.).</p>

<p>The special protection or paving required in connection
with weirs and such-like works is considered in
<a href="#Chap_X_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>, <i>Arts. 2</i></a> and <a href="#Chap_X_Art_3"><i>3</i></a>.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="large">WORKS FOR THE PROTECTION OF BANKS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_VI_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;The protection of a length
of bank from scour may be effected by spurs, which are
works projecting into the stream at intervals, or by
a continuous lining of the bank. A spur forms an
obstruction to the stream (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span></a>, <i>Art. 1</i>), and when
constructed, or even partly constructed, the scour near
its end may be very severe, even though there may be
little contraction of the stream as a whole. If the bed
is soft a hole is scoured out. Into this hole the spur
keeps subsiding, and its construction, or even its maintenance,
may be a matter of the greatest difficulty. A
high flood may destroy it. If it does not do so, it may
be because the stream has, for some reason, ceased to
attack the bank at that place. A continuous lining of
the bank is not open to any objection, and is generally
the best method of protection. Spurs made of large
numbers of rather small trees, weighted with nets filled
with stones, have been used on the great shifting rivers
of the Punjab which swallowed up enormous quantities
of materials. The use of spurs on such rivers has now,
in most cases, been given up. If L is the length of a
spur measured at right angles to the bank, the length of
bank which it protects is about 7 L&mdash;3 L upstream and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
4 L downstream,&mdash;but the spur has to be strongly built,
and its cost is, in many cases, not much less than the
expense of protecting the whole bank with a continuous
lining.</h3>

<p>Whatever method is adopted, a plan, large enough to
show all irregularities, should always be prepared, and
the line to which it is intended that the bank shall be
brought marked on it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_7" src="images/fig_7.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span></p></div>

<p>Sometimes natural spurs exist as, for instance, where a
tree projects into a stream or has fallen into it, and the
holes between the spurs may be deep, so that a continuous
protection would be expensive. Or there may be trees
standing in such positions that, if felled, they will be
in good places for spurs. In cases such as the above,
spurs may be suitable even in a stream with a soft
channel.</p>

<p>Regarding the use of spurs or groynes for diversion
works or for reducing the width of a stream, see <a href="#Chap_VII_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap.

<p>Combinations of the above are also used, for instance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
(<i>d</i>) or (<i>e</i>) may be used for the upper portion, the
foundation being (<i>a</i>) or (<i>c</i>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span></p></div>

<p>Instead of running out at right angles to the bank
a spur may be inclined somewhat downstream. This
somewhat reduces the eddying and scour round the end.
The ends of a system of spurs should be in the line
which it is intended that the edge of the stream shall
have (<a href="#fig_9">fig. 9</a>). The tops of short spurs are usually above
high flood level. Sometimes spurs are made to slope
downwards (<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>), and they then cause less disturbance
of the water and less scour than if built to the form shown
by the dotted line. Such spurs are sometimes combined
with a low wall running across the bed of the stream,
the whole forming a “profile” of the cross-section to
which it is intended to bring the channel. Regarding
such walls, see <a href="#Chap_V_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>. When a spur is long it
may have small subsidiary spurs (<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>) to reduce the
rush of water along it; or its end may have to be protected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
in the same manner as the advancing end of a
closure dam (<a href="#Chap_VII_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>).</p>

<p>The following is a curious case of misconception of
the action of spurs. In 1909 the river Indus was eroding
its right bank and threatening to destroy the town
of Dera Ghazi Khan. A clump of date palms formed
a promontory and resisted erosion to some extent. A
suggestion was made&mdash;by an engineer of eminence who
had formerly been consulted in the case&mdash;to the effect
that the date palms be removed, the reason given being
that they caused disturbance and scour. On this
principle spurs would have to be made not to protect
a bank but to cause it to be eroded.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_VI_Art_3">3. <b>Continuous Lining of the Bank.</b>&mdash;The lining or
protection of a bank may be of stone or brick pitching
(figs. 12 and 13), loose stone (<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>), fascines (<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>),
turfing, plantations, brushwood, or of other materials
laid on the slopes. Before protecting a bank it is best
to remove irregularities and bring it to a regular line.
This can generally be done most easily by filling in
hollows, but sometimes it is done by cutting off projections.
It is also necessary to make the side slope
uniform. Where the slope is as shown by the dotted
lines in figs. 12 to 14, filling in can be effected, but
cutting away the upper part of the slope is also feasible.
Such cutting away has been proposed as a remedy in
itself in cases where the steep upper part of the slope
was falling in, but it is not much of a remedy.</h3>

<p>Stone pitching may rest, if boats are required to come
close to the bank, on a toe wall of concrete, as in <a href="#fig_13">fig. 13</a>,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
or otherwise on a foundation of loose stone, as in <a href="#fig_12">fig. 12</a>.
When concrete is used the bed is dredged to such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
depth as will provide against undermining by scour.
Sloping boards attached to piles are placed along the
front face and the concrete is thrown in under water.
The slope of stone or brick pitching is usually from
2 to 1 to 1 to 1, but it may be as steep as ½ to 1. The
earth behind the pitching must be well rammed in
layers. In order to prevent the earth from being eaten
away by the water which penetrates through the interstices
of the stone or brick, a layer, 3 to 6 inches thick,
of gravel or ballast is placed over the earth and rammed.
When loose stone is used, dredging is not necessary, but
the stone is allowed to gradually sink down and more is
added at the top. A certain proportion of the stones
should be of large size.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p></div>

<p>When fascining is used, long twigs are made into
bundles and tied up at every 2 feet so as to form
fascines about 4 to 6 inches thick, and these are laid
on the slopes and secured by pegs driven in at short
intervals, between the fascines.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_14" src="images/fig_14.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14.</span></p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_15" src="images/fig_15.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span></p></div>

<p>Sometimes the pitching or loose stone is not carried
up to the top of the bank, or even up to high flood-level,
and the bank above the pitching is protected by turfing&mdash;the
pieces of turf being placed on edge normally to
the slope if very steep (<a href="#fig_14">fig. 14</a>) or laid parallel to the
slope if it is not very steep&mdash;or, above ordinary water-level,
by plantations of osiers or willows which obstruct
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the water and tend to cause silting, and whose roots
bind the banks together.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_16" src="images/fig_16.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span></p></div>

<p>Another method of using fascines is to lay them on
the slopes with their lengths normal to the direction of
the stream. The upper end of a fascine is above low
water, and the lower end extends down to the bed of
the stream. Sometimes large ropes made of straw, or
rough mats made of grass, are laid on the slopes and
pegged down, or mattresses of fascines are laid on the
slopes and weighted with stones.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_17" src="images/fig_17.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 17.</span></p></div>

<p>A deep recess in the bank (<a href="#fig_16">fig. 16</a>) can be filled in,
before the protection is added, with earth well rammed.
On the Adige the filling material consisted (<a href="#fig_17">fig. 17</a>) of
faggots filled with stones, small cross dams being made
at intervals, as shown by the dotted lines, to arrest flood
water and cause it to deposit silt. At the back of the
berm, poplar or willow slips were planted, and these
grew up and their roots held the bank together. This
system succeeded well.</p>

<p>A method of protection which is suitable when the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
water contains much silt is what is known in India as
bushing. Large leafy branches of trees are cut and
hung, as shown in <a href="#fig_18">fig. 18</a>, by ropes to pegs. They must
be closely packed so as not to shake. At first they
require looking after, but silt rapidly deposits and the
branches become fixed and no longer dependent on the
ropes. If the work is carefully done, the result is a
smooth, regular, and tenacious berm, as per dotted line
in the figure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_18" src="images/fig_18.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span></p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_19" src="images/fig_19.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span></p></div>

<p>Another method, used on canals, is to make up the
bank with earth and to revet it with twigs or reeds, as
shown in <a href="#fig_19">fig. 19</a>. The foundation must be taken down
well below bed-level, otherwise the work may slip. This
kind of work cannot be done except when the canal is
dry.</p>

<p>If the bank consists of sand or of very sandy soil, it
must in any case have a flat side slope such as 3 to 1.
If the sand is in layers alternating with firm soil, it is
a good plan to dig out some of the sand and to replace
it with clods of hard earth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p>Staking (<a href="#fig_20">fig. 20</a>) may be used, the stakes being one
or two feet apart from centre to centre, and long twigs
laid horizontally being passed in and out of the stakes,
or bushing filled in behind the stakes. But bushing
alone is cheaper and nearly as good.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_20" src="images/fig_20.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 20.</span></p></div>

<p>For protecting the banks of the Indus it has been
proposed (<i>Punjab Rivers and Works</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>) to use
trees in exactly the same manner as bushing, the trees
being grown in several rows parallel to the river so that
whenever the river, by eroding its bank, comes up to
the lines of trees the first row will fall in. The first row
would be chained to the second, which would take the
place of the pegs used in bushing. The other rows
would remain as a reserve.</p>

<p>The Villa system of bed protection (<a href="#Chap_V_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>)
has also been successfully used for bank protection on
the Scheldt, and on the Brussels-Ghent Canal, the
prisms being about 10 × 10 × 4 inches, and having
overlapping joints. The bands of prisms are placed
in position by a boat, the bands unrolling over a drum.
The boat is provided with an oscillating platform carrying
rollers at its end. A thin layer of gravel is laid
over the bank and is pressed down by the rollers before
the prisms are laid on it (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol.
cxxxiv., and vol. clxxv.).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>In the case of the river mentioned in <a href="#Chap_XI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>,
<i>Art. 3</i></a>, where extremely high velocities were met with,
cylindrical rolls of wire-netting were made, each 50 feet
long and 5 feet in diameter, and filled with boulders.
These rolls can be used for bank protection. The
netting was made by wires 6 inches apart, crossing
each other at right angles and tied together at the
crossings by short pieces of wire.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_21" src="images/fig_21.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21.</span></p></div>

<p>On ship canals a berm (<a href="#fig_21">fig. 21</a>) is frequently made a
few feet below the water-level. It serves as a foundation
for the pitching, which need not usually extend down to
more than 5 feet below the water-level. Below that
the wash has little or no effect on the banks. On
ordinary navigation canals a similar berm is sometimes
made&mdash;one or two feet in width and a foot or less below
the water-level&mdash;and rushes are planted on it.</p>

<p>Sometimes a bank has been protected by a kind of
artificial weed, consisting of bushes or branches of trees
attached to ropes. The end of the rope is fastened to
the bank and the weeds float in the stream alongside
the bank.</p>

<p>To protect a bank from ice, which exercises an uplifting
force on pitching, use has been made of a covering
of a kind of reinforced concrete consisting of slabs of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
concrete with wires embedded in it, and fastened to the
bank by wires, 20 inches long, running into the bank,
these wires being embedded in mortar so as to act like
stakes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22.</span></p></div>

<h3 id="Chap_VI_Art_4">4. <b>Heavy Stone Pitching with Apron.</b>&mdash;On the
great shifting rivers of India a system of bank protection
is adopted, consisting of a pitched slope with an
apron (<a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>). The system is used chiefly in connection
with railway bridges or weirs, but it has been used
in one instance, that of Dera Ghazi Khan, for the
protection of the bank near a town. When, as is usual,
the flood-level is higher than the river bank, an artificial
bank is made. In any case the bank is properly
aligned. The pitching has a slope of 2 to 1, and
consists of quarried blocks of stone loosely laid, the
largest blocks weighing perhaps 120 lbs. The apron
is laid at the time of low water on the sandbank or
bed of the stream. If necessary, the ground is specially
levelled for it. It is intended to slip when scour occurs.
The following dimensions of the apron are given by
Spring (<i>Government of India Technical Paper</i>, No. 153,
“River Training and Control on the Guide Bank System,”
1904). The probable maximum depth of scour can be
calculated as explained in <a href="#Chap_XI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>. If this
depth, measured from the toe of the slope pitching is D,
and if T is the thickness considered necessary for the slope
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
pitching, then the width of the apron should be 1·5 D,
and its thickness 1·25 T next the slope and 2·8 T next
the river. It will then be able to cover the scoured
slope to a thickness of 1·25 T. This thickness is made
greater than T because the stone is not likely to slip
quite regularly. The thickness T should, according to
Spring, be 16 inches to 52 inches, being least with a
slow current and a channel of coarse sand, and greatest
with a more rapid current and fine sand; but since the
sand is generally finer as the current is slower, it would
appear that a thickness of about 3 feet would generally
be suitable. Under the rough stone there should be
smaller pieces or bricks. Along the top of the bank
there is generally a line of rails so that stone from
reserve stacks, which are placed at intervals along the
bank, can be quickly brought to the spot in case the
river anywhere damages the pitched slope.</h3>

<h3 id="Chap_VII_Art_1">1. <b>Diversions.</b>&mdash;When a stream is permanently
diverted the new course is generally shorter than the
old one, and the diversion is then often called a cut-off.
The first result of a cut-off is a lowering of the water-level
upstream and a tendency to scour there, and to silt
downstream of the cut-off. <a href="#fig_23">Fig. 23</a> shows the longitudinal
section of a stream after a cut-off <i>A B</i> has been
made. The bed tends to assume the position shown by
the dotted line. If both the diversion and the old
channel are to remain open, the water-level at the
bifurcation will be lowered still more, and the tendency
to scour in the diversion will be reduced.</h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 23.</span></p></div>

<p>If the material is soft enough to be scoured by the
stream, it is often practicable to excavate a diversion to
a small section and to let it enlarge itself by scour.
This operation is immensely facilitated if the old channel
can be closed at the bifurcation. The question whether
the scoured material will deposit in the channel downstream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
of the diversion must be taken into consideration;
also the question whether the diversion will continue to
enlarge itself more than is desirable. The velocity in
the diversion will be a maximum if its section is of the
“best form,” <i>i.e.</i> if its bed and sides are tangents to
a semicircle whose diameter coincides with the water
surface, but this may not (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>) be the
section which will give most scour. In order to prevent
the enlargement of the diversion taking place irregularly,
the excavation can be made as shown in <a href="#fig_24">fig. 24</a>, water
being admitted only to the central gullet. The side
gullets should not be quite continuous, but unexcavated
portions should be left at intervals, so that if the water
in scouring out the channel breaks into the gullet, it
will not be able to flow along it until it has broken in
all along.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_24" src="images/fig_24.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 24.</span></p></div>

<p>If a diversion is made, not with the object of lowering
the water-level but merely in order to shorten the
channel, the increased velocity caused by the steepened
slope may be inconvenient. In this case a weir or weirs
can be added (<a href="#Chap_VIII_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span>, <i>Art. 4</i>)</a>.</p>

<p>If the water contains sufficient silt to enable the
abandoned loop to be silted up within a reasonable time,
it may be desirable to do this. The silting up may, for
instance, increase the value of the land. The loop
should be closed at its upper end. Water entering the
lower end will cause a deposit there. When the lower
end is well obstructed by silt, the upper end should be
opened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>The set of the stream, due, for instance, to a bend at
the point where a diversion takes off has very little to
do with the quantity of water which goes down the
diversion. The only effect of the set of the stream is
a slight rise of the water-level as compared with the
opposite bank. Similarly, the angle at which the
diversion takes off is only of importance in giving, in
some cases, a velocity of approach whose effect is
generally small. The distribution of the water between
the diversion and the old channel really depends on
their relative discharging capacities. If the required
quantity of water does not flow down a diversion it
can be dredged.</p>

<p>Sometimes a long spur is run out to send the water
towards the off-take of a diversion. The effect of this
is very small&mdash;it merely causes a set of the stream,&mdash;unless
its length is so great that it amounts to something
like a closure dam. It is sometimes said that it is easier
to lead a river than to drive it. This remark is probably
based on the fact that spurs, such as those under consideration,
generally produce little effect, whereas the
excavation of a diversion or the deepening of a branch
by dredging it, is more likely to produce some result.
There is, however, no certainty about this. Sometimes
too much is expected of such channels. Calculations
are not always made as to the scouring power of the
stream, nor is account always taken of the fact that as
the cut scours its gradient flattens.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_VII_Art_2">2. <b>Closure of a Flowing Stream.</b>&mdash;The closure of
a flowing stream by means of a dam is usually attended
with some difficulty and sometimes with enormous
difficulty. There may be little trouble in running out
dams from both banks for a certain distance, but as soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
as the gap between the dams becomes much less than
the original width of the stream, the water on the upstream
side is headed up and there is a rush of water
through the gap, which tends to deeply scour the bed
and to undermine the dams. The smaller the gap
becomes the greater is the rush and scour.</h3>

<p>The closure is most easily effected at or near to the
place where the stream bifurcates from another. Then,
as the gap decreases in width, some of the water is
driven down the other stream and it does not rise so
much. Eventually all the water goes down the other
stream, and the total rise is only so much as will enable
this other stream to carry the increased discharge. If
the closure is not effected near a bifurcation, the rise of
the water will go on even after the closure is completed,
and it will not cease, unless the water escapes or breaks
out somewhere, until it has risen to the same level as
that to which it would have risen if the closure had
been at the bifurcation, or perhaps not quite to the
same level, since there may still be a slight slope in the
water surface and a small discharge which percolates
through the dam. Sometimes in such a case it is
possible to arrange for temporary escapes or bifurcations,
which will be shallow and therefore easily closed,
after the main closure has been completed.</p>

<p>A closure is, of course, far more easily effected where
the bed is hard than where it is soft. Very often it is
best to close temporarily at such a place or near a
bifurcation, even if the permanent dam has to be
elsewhere, and then to construct the permanent dam
in the dry channel, or in the still water, and remove
the temporary one or cut a gap in it.</p>

<p>Generally the best method to adopt in a closure is to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
cover the bed of the channel beforehand&mdash;unless it is
already hard enough&mdash;with a mattress or floor, such
that it cannot be scoured as the gap closes. A floor
may consist of a number of stones or sandbags dropped
in from boats or by any suitable means, and placed
with care so that there shall not be gaps or mounds.
Sandbags should be carefully sewn up. A mattress
may be made of fascines laid side by side and tied
together, floated into position, weighted and sunk.
Even a carpet made of matting or cloth and suitably
weighted has sufficed in some cases. If the scour is
likely to be such that stones or sandbags will be carried
away, the stones may be placed in nets, baskets, or crates.
Sandbags may also be placed in nets. Probably the
long rolls of wire-netting filled with stones, described in
<a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>, would be better than anything, and
the diameter could be reduced somewhat. The floor
or mattress need not usually extend right across the
stream. It must cover a width much greater than&mdash;perhaps
twice as great as&mdash;the width of the gap is likely
to be when scour begins. Its length, measured parallel
to the direction of the stream, must be such that severe
eddies in the contracted stream will have ceased before
the stream reaches its downstream edge. It need not
extend to any considerable distance upstream of the
line of the dam.</p>

<p>The dams when started from the banks can generally
be of simple earth or gravel, or loose stones, but before
they have advanced far they will probably require
protection at the ends by stones, or by staking and
brushwood, or by fascines. As soon as the dams have
advanced well onto the mattress and their ends have
been well protected, it is best to cease contracting the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
stream from the sides and to contract it from the
bottom by laying a number of sandbags across the gap
so as to form a submerged weir. In this way the rush
of water is spread over a considerable width of the
stream. The weir is then raised until it comes up
above water. Leakage can be stopped by throwing in
earth, or gravel, or bundles of grass on the upstream
side. Sometimes it is best to construct the mattress
over the whole width of the stream, and to effect the
closure entirely by a weir, carrying each layer right
across before adding another. The banks of the stream,
if not hard, can be protected by sandbags, stones,
staking or fascining.</p>

<p>The chief cause of failures of attempts to close flowing
streams is neglect to provide a proper floor or mattress.
The stones or other materials may be of insufficient
weight or not closely laid, or the extent of the floor
may be insufficient. In a soft channel and deep water
loose stones in almost any quantity may fail unless a
mattress of fascines is laid under them. Another cause
of failure is running short of materials, such as sandbags.
Allowance should be made for every contingency, including
making good any failure of parts of the
work. Enormous sums of money have been wasted,
and vast inconvenience, loss and trouble incurred,
in futile attempts to close breaches in banks, or gaps
in dams.</p>

<p>Sometimes the gap is closed by sinking a barge loaded
with stones, or by sinking a “cradle” or large mattress
made of fascines, taken out to the site by four boats,
one supporting each corner, and then loaded with stones
and sunk. Another method is to run out a floating
mattress of fascines from one side of the gap to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
middle and sink it, then to proceed similarly on the
other side, and so on.</p>

<p>An excellent plan, when it can be adopted, is to have
more than one line of operations, so that the heading up
of the water is divided between them.</p>

<p>In India closures of streams having depths of 6 or 8
feet are effected by means of rough trestles made from
trunks of small trees and placed at intervals in the
stream like bridge piers, one leg of the trestle inclined
upstream and one downstream. Each pair of adjacent
trestles is connected by a number of rough, horizontal
poles. Against these are placed bundles of brushwood.
Earth is at the same time collected and is rapidly added
at the last. The chief danger is the undermining of
the bed by scour. This is prevented by driving in
stakes and placing brushwood against them. Closures
of small channels or of breaches in the banks of canals
are effected by means of staking and brushwood.
Where dangerous breaches are liable to occur, it is a good
plan to have a barge, fitted up with a small pile-driver
and carrying a supply of sheet piles, ready at a
convenient spot.</p>

<p>Hurdle dykes, first used on the Mississippi, were
employed on the Indus in 1902 to close partially the
main channel of the river. There were to be three
dykes, each dyke consisting of three lines of very long
piles&mdash;some were 60 feet long,&mdash;driven into the bed of
the stream, which was to be protected with mattresses
made of fascines and extending right across it, with
their heads above flood-level. The idea was not to
wholly stop the flow of the water, but to obstruct it
so much that silt would deposit, the channel become
choked up, and the water find a course down another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
channel. The work was begun in March 1902, and was
in progress in May of the same year when an unusually
early flood put a stop to it. The dykes had at this
time advanced considerable distances from the right
bank of the stream, but none had been completed.
Two dykes out of the three were for the most part
carried away. The river, however, took a new course,
starting from a point far upstream, the western channel
became a creek, and the remains of the dykes were
soon embedded in silt.</p>

<p>In any case in which the provision of a proper
mattress has been omitted, or when the mattress has
been destroyed, or when a breach has occurred in
an embankment, whenever, in short, it is evident
that the gap cannot be closed until some other
escape for the water is provided, it may be possible
to provide such an escape by cutting partly through
the dam or embankment on the downstream side
at another place, and thoroughly protecting the
place and extending the protection downstream and
away from the dam or embankment. The water
can then be let in, and the closure of the old gap
attempted. If a closure is effected, the protected gap
can then be closed. Sometimes it may be desirable
to make such a protected gap beforehand and with
deliberation.</p>

<p>Dams for closing streams which are dry can be made
similarly to flood embankments (<a href="#Chap_XII_Art_7"><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>, <i>Art. 7</i></a>).
Sand does very well, provided it is protected by a
covering of clay or by fascining.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_VII_Art_3">3. <b>Instances of Closures of Streams.</b>&mdash;In 1904
the Colorado River broke into the Salton Sink&mdash;a valley
covering 4000 square miles. Unsuccessful attempts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
were made to close the stream by two rows of piles
with willows and sandbags between them, by a gate
200 feet long, supported on 500 piles, and by twelve
gates each 12 feet wide. A “rock-fill” dam was then
constructed on a mattress 100 feet wide and 1·5 feet
thick. The river, which was 600 feet wide, broke
through, but was stopped by the construction of three
parallel rock-fill dams in the gap (<i>Min. Proc. Inst.
C.E.</i>, vol. clxxi.).</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_25" src="images/fig_25.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 25.</span></p></div>

<p>At the site of the railway bridge over the river Tista in
Bengal, it was necessary to close the main stream
(<a href="#fig_25">fig. 25</a>), which flowed at the left side of the channel,
while the bridge had been built at the right. The bed
was of sand, width 500 feet, depth 6 feet, and discharge
3700 cubic feet per second. The first attempt to close
the stream was made at M N, a floor of stone 200 feet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
long, 20 feet wide, and 2 feet thick, being laid in the
middle of the stream, and dams of earth, sandbags, and
stones being run out from each bank. As the gap
decreased in width the bed was torn up and the work
failed. The heading up was 3 feet 9 inches. It was
recognised later that the site should have been at the
bifurcation higher up, and that the stone floor should
have been laid on a mattress.</p>

<p>In the next working season the dams C D and E F G
were made. The dam C D was of earth. Two walls,
each consisting of a double line of bamboos with the
spaces between the lines filled with bundles of grass
weighted with earth, were run out 50 feet in advance
of the earthwork near the lines of the toes of the
slopes. Along the line of the upper wall a mattress of
broken bricks 10 feet in width, and 1 foot thick, was
laid, and was kept 50 feet in advance of the wall. A
total length of 1000 feet of embankment was made in
five months and pitched on its upstream side. The
end was strongly protected by a mass of stone. The
embankment F G was of earth. The dam E F consisted
of three lines of piles driven 10 feet into the bed. A
mattress weighted with stones extended for 20 feet
upstream of the dam and 40 feet downstream. A gap
of 150 feet was left at D E, and was not protected by a
floor of any kind. A channel, parallel to F G and
extending to K, had been dug to a width of 200 feet.
During the floods the heading up at D E was about 2·5
feet, and the water was 30 feet deep. The line E F was
greatly damaged and was repaired. The cut F G K
gradually enlarged, and by the end of the floods more
water was going down it than down the main stream.
The gap D E was finally closed by means of a line of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
bamboos and grass, the bed being protected by a carpet,
100 × 50 feet, made of common cloth weighted with sandbags.
The success of the operations turned on the
scouring out of the cut F G K. It is remarkable that
the gap D E did not become wholly unmanageable in
the floods (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. cl.).

<span class="large">THE TRAINING AND CANALISATION OF RIVERS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_VIII_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;When a stream is trained
or regularised it is generally made narrower, but sometimes
narrow places have to be widened. Deepening
has also very frequently to be effected. The object of
training is generally the improvement of navigation, but
it may be the prevention of silt deposit. Some natural
arms of rivers which form the head reaches of canals in
the Punjab are wide and tortuous, and they are sometimes
trained. Training often includes straightening or
the cutting-off of bends, as to which reference may be
made to <a href="#CHAPTER_VII"><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span></a></h3>

<h3 id="Chap_VIII_Art_2">2. <b>Dredging and Excavating.</b>&mdash;When a flowing
stream is to be deepened, the work is usually done by
dredgers. Dredgers can remove mud, sand, clay,
boulders, or broken pieces of rock. The “bucket ladder”
dredger is the commonest type. The “dipper” dredger
is another. Both these can work in depths of water
ranging up to 35 feet. The “grab bucket” dredger
can work up to any depth and in a confined space.
The “suction dredger” drawls up mud or sand mixed
with water. A dredger may be fitted with a hopper or
movable bottom, by means of which it can discharge the
dredged material&mdash;this, however, involves cessation of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
work while the dredger makes a journey to the place
where the material is to be deposited&mdash;or it can discharge
into hopper barges or directly on to the shore
by means of long shoots. For small works in comparatively
shallow water the “bag and spoon” dredger,
worked by two men, can be used.</h3>

<p>When rock has to be removed under water it is
blasted or broken up by the blows of heavy rams provided
with steel-pointed cutters.</p>

<p>In widening a channel the excavation can be carried
down in the ordinary way to below the water-level, a
narrow piece of earth, like a wall, being left to keep the
water out. If the channel cannot be laid dry, the work
can be finished by dredging.</p>

<p>Regarding methods by which the stream is itself
made to deepen or widen its channel, reference may be
made to <a href="#CHAPTER_V"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span></a></p>

<h3 id="Chap_VIII_Art_3">3. <b>Reduction of Width.</b>&mdash;If a channel which is to
be narrowed is not a wide one, the reduction in width
can be effected by any of the processes described under
bank protection (<a href="#CHAPTER_VI"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span></a>). But in a wide channel,
reduction of the width by any direct process is generally
impracticable. The expense would generally be prohibitive.
Earth, if filled in, is liable to be washed away
unless protected all along. Reduction in the width of
a large channel is nearly always effected either by
groynes (<a href="#fig_26">fig. 26</a>) or by training walls (<a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>). Spurs
or short groynes for bank protection have been already
described (<a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>). Groynes for narrowing
streams are made in the same way and of the same
materials, but are longer. They are at right angles to
the stream or nearly so. Groynes in the river Sutlej
have been mentioned in <a href="#Chap_V_Art_5"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 5</i></a>, and are shown
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
in <a href="#fig_6">fig. 6</a>, p. 55. Whether groynes or training walls are
used, the object is to confine the stream to a definite
zone and to silt up the spaces at the sides. These
spaces when partly silted can be planted with osiers or
with anything which will grow when partly submerged,
and this will assist in completing the silting.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_26" src="images/fig_26.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span></p></div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_27" src="images/fig_27.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27.</span></p></div>

<p>A training wall can be made of any of the materials
used for groynes. In order to silt up the spaces between
each wall and the adjacent bank of the stream, other
walls are run at intervals across them. Usually the
training walls and cross walls are carried up only to
ordinary water-level, sometimes only to low-water level.
Floods can thus spread out and submerge the walls and
deposit silt. If the walls are carried up too high it may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
be necessary, in order to give room for floods, to space
them too far apart, and this, as will be seen below, is
objectionable.</p>

<p>The difference between training walls and groynes is
one of degree rather than one of kind. The material
most commonly used is, in either case, loose stone&mdash;with
pitching, if desired, above low-water level,&mdash;but it may
be wattled stakes. If the water of the stream contains
silt at all stages of the supply, gaps can be left in
training walls so that silt deposit may occur at all
times and not only in floods. If the walls are of
wattled stakes, water will pass through them, and it
may not be necessary to leave any gaps. Groynes are
frequently made with <b>T</b>-heads (<a href="#fig_26">fig. 26</a>), and they are
thus equivalent to training walls with long gaps in
them. The edge of the narrowed channel usually forms
somewhat as shown in the figure. If the groynes are
placed so near together as to give a regular channel, the
cost is not likely to be much less than that of training
walls.</p>

<p>The alignment of training walls or groynes should be
such as will give the best channel consistent with
economy in cost. The best channel is generally that
which is most free from sharp bends. It is assumed for
the present that no cuts or diversions of such lengths
as to materially alter the gradient are to be made, but
that a certain amount of choice of alignment is afforded
by the reduced width of the trained channel and by
small diversions or easings of bends. It is sometimes
said that straight reaches are objectionable because the
stream will tend to wander from side to side and cause
shoals, whereas in a bend there will be no such
tendency. The difficulty as to shoaling will be greatest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
at low water, but it is likely to be serious only when the
width between the training walls is too great. If the
width cannot be reduced to such an extent as to do
away with the trouble, it may be better to adopt a
curved course. The width between the training walls
should generally be the same throughout, whether the
reaches are straight or curved, but in view of the
preceding remarks it may be desirable, where a reach
cannot be otherwise than straight and where shoaling is
feared, to give the straight portion a reduced width
with of course a greater depth, and similarly to reduce
the width at reverse changes of curvature. In curves
which are at all sharp the curvature should be rather
sharper in the middle of the curve than at the ends
(<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_8"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 8</i></a>).</p>

<h3 id="Chap_VIII_Art_4">4. <b>Alteration of Depth or Water-Level.</b>&mdash;When
the width of a stream is altered, the depth of water&mdash;the
gradient being supposed to be unchanged&mdash;must
alter in the opposite manner. A narrowing of the
channel by training necessitates an increase in the
depth of water, and the same remark applies if an arm
of the stream is closed. The increase in depth may be
effected either by raising the water-level or by lowering
the bed&mdash;as may be convenient&mdash;or both. If the bed
is to be lowered and is of hard clay, it may be necessary
to dredge it and, when this has been done, training may
be unnecessary. If the bed is of soft mud, a dredged
channel is likely to fill up again, and training alone will
be the method to adopt. If the bed is moderately hard,
say compact sand, it may be suitable to train the
channel first and then to dredge if necessary. In any
case, shoals of hard material may have to be dredged
or rocks, whether these form shoals or lateral obstructions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
to be blasted or otherwise broken up (<i>Art.
2</i>). In cases where it is desired to raise the water-level
without any lowering of the bed, training is of
course necessary. In any case in which the bed is
likely to scour to a lower level than is desired, or if the
bed is to be raised, the measures described in <a href="#Chap_V_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>,
<i>Art. 6</i></a>, may be adopted, but they are hardly likely to
be suitable and satisfactory in all cases.</h3>

<h3 id="Chap_VIII_Art_5">5. <b>Training and Canalising.</b>&mdash;The steps so far
described, together with any of those described in
<a href="#CHAPTER_V"><span class="smcap">Chaps. V.</span></a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VI">VI.</a>, exhaust the list of what can be
done so long as only the cross-section of a stream is
dealt with. This is often called the “regulation” of a
stream, though “training” is a more satisfactory term.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_28" src="images/fig_28.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span></p></div>

<p>A mere alteration of the cross-section of a stream will
not always afford a solution of the problem to be solved.
Frequently a change of gradient is required. The
gradient can be steepened by means of straightenings,
or flattened by introducing weirs, or perhaps by adopting
a course somewhat more circuitous than was
intended. This extended scope of operations is known
as canalising in the case of a river, and remodelling in
the case of a canal.</p>

<p>Suppose that it is desired to alter the cross-section of
a stream, at ordinary water-level, so as to reduce the
width and increase the depth (<a href="#fig_28">fig. 28</a>). If the mean
depth is doubled, the new width will be about equal to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
1/(3·2) of the old width (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i>).
If this gives too narrow a channel, it may be desirable
to flatten the gradient. If it gives too wide a channel,
the gradient can be steepened or a greater depth
adopted. While the width and depth of the stream will
be fixed so as to be suitable for the navigation, the ratio
of depth to velocity should be so arranged, if this is
possible, as to minimise trouble connected with silting
or scour (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>). A remodelled channel is,
in short, designed in exactly the same way as a new
channel. The depth of water exercises the greatest
effect on the discharge, and the gradient the least. The
weak point in a scheme which includes weirs is the
difficulty of dealing with floods. A scheme perfect in
all other respects may be vitiated because of the
obstruction, caused by weirs, to the passage of floods.
The difficulty is got over by means of movable weirs.
The whole subject of weirs is dealt with in <a href="#CHAPTER_X"><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span></a></p>

<p>Training or canalising should not be effected in any
reach of a stream without regard to other reaches. A
mere local lowering of the water-level by dredging may
accentuate the effect of a shoal at the upper end of the
reach.</p>

<p>When the water-level is raised by a weir or by
narrowing the channel&mdash;though in the latter case the
raising may not be permanent&mdash;it is generally best to
commence the work from the upstream end. The
raising of the water-level will then not interfere with
the execution of the rest of the work. But in a case of
widening, where the water-level upstream of the work
is lowered, the work can conveniently be begun at the
downstream end, and the remark applies also to a case of
straightening, provided that the new channel is not so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
small that it at first causes no lowering. In any case in
which there is a doubt whether the whole of the scheme
will be carried out, the reach to be dealt with first can
be decided on according to circumstances. There is no
general reason for selecting an upstream or downstream
reach, except that any raising or lowering of the
water-level will extend upstream of the reach and not
downstream of it (<a href="#Chap_I_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>, <i>Art. 4</i></a>).</p>

<p>Training walls and groynes, if made with stakes or
fascines or any materials except stone, require careful
watching and maintenance.

<span class="large">CANALS AND CONDUITS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_IX_Art_1">1. <b>Banks.</b>&mdash;All banks which have to hold up water
should be carefully made. The earth should be deposited
in layers and all clods broken up. In high
banks the layers should be moistened and rammed.
The dotted lines in <a href="#fig_29">fig. 29</a> show two possible courses
of percolation water. The vertical height&mdash;from the
water-level to the ground outside the bank,&mdash;divided
by the length of the line of percolation is the hydraulic
gradient, as in the case of a pipe, and this gradient is
more or less a measure of the tendency to leakage.
A bank which has water constantly against it nearly
always becomes almost water-tight in time. The time
is less or greater according as the soil is better, and
according to the amount of care with which the bank
is made.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_29" src="images/fig_29.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span></p></div>

<p>The side slopes of banks vary with the soil. Generally
they are 1½ to 1, but they are sometimes 2 to 1 or even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
3 to 1 if the soil is bad or sandy, or if great precautions
against breaches are to be taken.</p>

<p>Leakage can sometimes be stopped by throwing chaff
or other finely divided substances into the water at the
site of the leak. In other cases it is necessary to dig
up part of the bank, find the channel by which the
water is escaping, and fill it up by adding earth and
ramming. On some navigable canals in France it was
at one time the custom to lay the reach dry, when a
bad leak occurred, and to dig away the bank and lay
slabs of concrete or puddle over the place. This plan
was abandoned, and instead of it sheet piles are driven
in. They are then withdrawn one at a time and, if any
leakage occurs, the space is filled with concrete.</p>

<p>The dimensions of a bank should depend to some
extent on the head of water against it and on the
volume of the stream whose water it holds up. A
breach is obviously more serious the greater the volume
of the escaping water. This volume depends on the size of
the stream and on its velocity. In navigation canals in
England the bank on the side opposite the towing-path
is usually 4 to 6 feet wide and 1½ feet above the water.
In irrigation canals in India the bank of a very large
canal is 2 feet above the water and 20 feet wide, while
that of a small canal with 6 feet of water is 8 or 10 feet
wide and 1½ feet above the water, and that of a small
distributary channel with 3 feet of water is 4 feet wide
and 1 foot above the water. The soil is often poor.</p>

<p>Further remarks, which apply to banks of special
height or special importance, are given under Embankments
(<a href="#Chap_XII_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. XII.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>).</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IX_Art_2">2. <b>Navigation Canals.</b>&mdash;A navigation canal is
sometimes all on one level, but generally different
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
reaches are at different levels, the change being made
by means of locks. A “lateral” canal&mdash;the most
common kind&mdash;runs along a river valley more or less
parallel to the river. It is frequently cheaper to
construct such a canal than to canalise the river. A
“summit” canal crosses over a ridge and connects
two valleys. A navigation canal requires a supply of
water to make good the losses which occur by lockage,
leakage, or absorption and evaporation. A canal may
be of any size, according to the size of the boats which
are to be used. There is always room, except in short
reaches where the expense of construction has to be
kept down, for two boats to pass one another.</h3>

<p>A lateral canal obtains water from the river or from
the small affluents which it crosses. For a summit
canal it may be necessary to provide storage reservoirs.
The canal crosses the ridge where it is low, and the
reservoirs are made on higher ground. Reservoirs may
be required also for other canals to hold water for use
in dry seasons or in order to fill the canal quickly when
laid dry for repairs.</p>

<p>In tropical countries weeds grow profusely in canals
which have still or nearly still water. Traffic tends
to keep them down, but they have to be cleared
periodically.</p>

<p>In designing a barge canal the chief considerations
generally are that it shall not be in such low ground or
so near a river as to be liable to damage by floods, that
it shall not traverse very permeable soil or gravel&mdash;this
is often found near a river,&mdash;that the material excavated
shall be as nearly as possible equal to that required, at
the same place, for embankment, and that as far as
possible high embankments, which are very expensive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
to construct and are more or less a source of danger,
shall be avoided. The side slopes of the banks of a
navigation canal depend on the nature of the soil.
They are generally 1½ to 1, but the inner slope may be
2 to 1. The banks are generally 1½ or 2 feet above the
water-level, the width of the bank on the towing-path
side ranging from 8 to 16 feet, but being generally 12
feet and the width of the other bank 4 to 6 feet. The
width of a canal is made sufficient for two boats to
pass, and the depth is 1½ to 2 feet greater than the
draught of the boats used. In some cases the banks
are protected by pitching for short lengths, but generally
they are merely turfed. The sides near the water
surface wear away, so that the side slope becomes
steeper in the upper part and flatter in the lower part.
The resistance of a boat to traction in a canal is given
by the formula

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">R = <i>r</i>(8·46)/(2 + (A/<i>a</i>)),<br /></span>
</span></span>

where <i>r</i> is the resistance in a large body of water and A
and <i>a</i> are the areas of the cross-sections of the canal
and of the immersed part of the boat. When A is six
times <i>a</i>, R is only 6 per cent. more than <i>r</i>. In practice
A is never less than six times <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>Regarding methods of protecting banks, see <a href="#CHAPTER_VI"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span></a></p>

<p>A ship canal is a barge canal on a large scale. The
speed of ships has to be strictly limited to avoid damage
to the banks.</p>

<p>The Manchester Ship Canal takes in the waters of the
Irwell and the Mersey, and conveys them for several
miles. It is thus a canalised river for part of its course.
Below that it is a tidal stream, the tide being admitted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
at its lower end where it joins the estuary of the Mersey,
and passing out higher up where it leaves the estuary
after skirting it. This circulation of water is beneficial
to the estuary.</p>

<p>The Panama Canal might have been constructed at
one level, but the cost of this, and the time occupied,
would have been double that of making it a summit
canal. The water of the river Chagres is to be
impounded to form a lake of great extent that will not
only supply water for lockage but will itself form part
of the high-level reach of the canal, and ships will be
able to traverse it at greater speed than in the rest of
the canal.</p>

<p>Some Indian irrigation canals have been constructed
so as to be navigable. The increase in cost has
usually been enormously in excess of any resulting
benefits.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IX_Art_3">3. <b>Locks.</b>&mdash;An ordinary lock is shown in <a href="#fig_29a">fig. 29</a><small>A</small>.
The space above the head gates is called the “head bay,”
and that below the tail gates the “tail bay.” The
floor of the lock is often an inverted arch. Sometimes
the floor is of cast-iron. The “lift wall” is generally
a horizontal arch. The gates when closed press at
their lower ends against the “mitre sills”; and the
vertical “mitre posts” at the edges of the gates meet
and are pressed together. The gate, in opening and
closing, revolves above the cylindrical “heel post”&mdash;which
stands in the “hollow quoin” of the lock wall&mdash;and
when fully open is contained in the “gate recess.”</h3>

<p>A lock is always strongly built, of masonry or
concrete. The walls have to withstand the earth
pressure when the lock is laid dry for repairs. The
floor has to withstand the scouring action from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
sluices. Regarding the upward pressure of the water
when the lock is empty, see <a href="#Chap_X_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. X.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>. The lift
or difference in the water-levels of the two reaches of a
barge canal is generally from 4 to 9 feet, but occasionally
it is much more.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_29a" src="images/fig_29a.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29a.</span></p></div>

<p>The gates of small locks are generally of wood and
are counterbalanced. Those of large locks are of wood
or steel, and the weight is generally taken by rollers.
Ordinary wood should not be used if the <i>Teredo navalis</i>
exists in the waters. An iron gate, if enclosed on all
sides by plating, is buoyant, and the rollers and anchor
straps which hold the upper ends of the heel posts
are thus relieved of much weight. The gates of the
Panama Canal locks are 110 feet long and 7 feet thick,
and the height ranges from 48 feet to 82 feet.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>The sluices for filling and emptying a lock are placed
in the gates or in the walls. The gates and sluices
are generally worked by hydraulic power or by
electricity.</p>

<p>Locks are frequently arranged in flights. There are,
in a few instances, 20 to 30 locks in a flight, the total
lift being 150 to 200 feet. By this means the number
of gates is reduced, the tail gates of one lock being the
head gates of the rest, and there is a saving in labour
in working the locks.</p>

<p>Let L be the volume of water contained in a lock
between the levels of the upper and lower reaches, and
let B be the submerged volume of a boat. The
“lockage” or volume of water withdrawn from the
upper reach of the canal is shown in the following
statement:&mdash;</p>

<p>In the case of a single lock, if two boats are to pass
through, one descending and one ascending (cases 2 and
3), the descending boat would be passed through first if
the lock were full, and the ascending boat first if empty;
in either case, the total lockage is L, or L/2 for each boat.
This also appears from case 5. Cases 6 to 10 show that
if a long train of boats descends, even though the lock
is full for the first boat or if a long train ascends even
the lock is empty for the first boat, the total lockage
is nearly L per boat. Thus in a single lock, boats
should pass up and down alternately so far as this may
be possible.</p>

<p>In the case of a flight of <i>m</i> locks, a single boat in
descending uses no more water than if there were only
one lock, the same water passing from lock to lock, but
in ascending it uses more. In the case of a number
(2<i>n</i>) of boats going up and down alternately (case 5),
the lockage is <i>m</i> <i>n</i> L, the lockage per lock per boat being
followed by an equal train ascending (cases 7 and 8),
the lockage is less. If <i>n</i> is supposed to be equal to <i>m</i>,
the average lockage per boat is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table id="mlocks">
  <tr>
    <td><i>m</i></td>
    <td> = </td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>6</td>
    <td>Infinity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lockage<br />

    <td> = </td>
    <td>L̲<br />2</td>
    <td>L</td>
    <td>7̲L̲<br />6</td>

    <td>4̲L̲<br />3</td>
    <td>3̲L̲<br />2<br />
</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>Thus in a case where <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> are very large, the
average lockage per boat, when the boats pass up and
down in trains, is to the lockage per boat, when the
single boats pass up and down alternately through <i>m</i>
single locks all at different places, as 3 is to <i>m</i>. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
reason for the difference, which may appear puzzling, is
that when the locks are at different places they are
worked independently of one another.</p>

<p>Sometimes a lock is provided with intermediate gates
which provide a short lock for short vessels. In the
Manchester Ship Canal, alongside each lock there is
another of smaller size to be used for small vessels and
thus save lockage. At the Eastham lock, where the
Manchester Ship Canal descends into the estuary of the
Mersey, there is, below the tail gates, an extra pair of
gates opening towards the estuary, so that the lock can
be worked when the water of the estuary is higher than
that in the canal. Water can be economised by means
of a “side-pond,” into which the upper portion of the
water from a lock can be discharged and utilised again
when the lock has to be filled. If two locks are built
side by side, each acts as a side-pond to the other. Two
flights of locks can be built side by side.</p>

<p>Sometimes instead of a lock there is an inclined plane,
up or down which are drawn on rails caissons containing
water in which the boats float. The rails extend below
the water-levels of the two reaches, and the caissons can
thus be run under the boats. “Lifts” have also been
constructed by which the boats can be lifted bodily and
swung over from one reach to the other.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_IX_Art_4">4. <b>Other Artificial Channels.</b>&mdash;The method of
calculating the discharges of channels in which water is
to flow is a question of hydraulics. The principles and
rules to be followed, in the design of earthen channels,
have been stated in <a href="#Chap_IV_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>, and in <a href="#Chap_VIII_Art_5"><span class="smcap">Chap.
VIII.</span>, <i>Art. 5</i></a>. The design of banks has been dealt with
in <i>Art. 1</i> of this Chapter. For conveying water for
the supply of towns, or for other purposes, masonry conduits
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
are often used. A usual form is shown in <a href="#fig_30">fig. 30</a>.
The curving of the profile of the cross-section gives an
increased sectional area and hydraulic radius, and hence
an increased discharge.</h3>

<span class="large">WEIRS AND SLUICES</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_1">1. <b>Preliminary Remarks.</b>&mdash;Every structure which
interferes at all with a stream causes an abrupt change
in the stream (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 1</i></a>). At an abrupt change
there are always eddies, and these have a peculiar scouring
effect. This effect is greatest where the velocity of
the stream is abruptly reduced as where, for instance,
after being contracted by an obstruction, it expands
again or where it falls over a weir or issues from a sluice
opening. In all cases of this kind the protection of the
structure from scour is of primary importance.</h3>

<p>The site of a weir or other permanent structure should,
if the stream is unstable, be in a fairly straight reach,
or at least not be immediately downstream of a bend.
This is because of the tendency of bends to shift downstream
(<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_8"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 8</i></a>). There is no particular
advantage in selecting a narrow place. A narrow
place is likely to be deep or it may be liable to
widen. In a hard and stable stream there is no restriction
as to site.</p>

<p>Weirs are frequently constructed for purposes of
navigation, as mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_VIII"><span class="smcap">Chap. VIII.</span></a> They are also
used in streams which are not navigable in order that
the gradient may not be too steep, and in irrigation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
canals for the same reason. They are used both in
rivers and canals in order that the water-level may be
raised and water drawn off by branch channels for
purposes of manufactures, water-power or irrigation.</p>

<p>Upstream of a weir there is more or less tendency for
silt to deposit, but it by no means follows that there will
be deposit (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>, last par., and <a href="#Chap_IV_Art_3"><i>Art. 3</i></a>,
last par.). When deposit of sand or mud is feared, small
horizontal passages, known as “weep holes,” may be left
in the weir at the level of the upstream bed. In the
old Nile barrages iron gratings were provided, but they
were needlessly large.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_31" src="images/fig_31.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31.</span></p></div>

<p>An inherent defect of an ordinary weir is that
it obstructs the passage of
floods. The obstruction may
or may not be of consequence.
Sometimes it is of great consequence.
Attempts have
been made to partially
remedy the evil by placing
the weir obliquely to the stream, thus giving it a
greater length. At ordinary water-levels the flow
over the crest of the weir is normal to its length,
or nearly so. Supposing that the water has to be
held up to a given level, the crest of the weir must
be higher, because of its greater length, than if it
were normal to the stream. In a flood the water has
a high velocity and flows over the weir in a direction
nearly parallel to the axis of the stream, so that the
effective length of the weir is not much greater than if
it were normal to the stream, and, its crest being higher,
it obstructs the flood as much. Oblique weirs are
usually made as in <a href="#fig_31">fig. 31</a>. If made in one straight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
line, there might be excessive action on the bank at the
lower end.</p>

<p>If the weir is lengthened, not by being built obliquely
but by a widening of the stream at the site, the crest
has to be raised and nothing is gained.</p>

<p>The only arrangement by which a weir can be made
to hold up water when a stream is low and to let floods
pass freely, consists in having part of the weir movable,
<i>i.e.</i> consisting of gates, shutters or horizontal or vertical
timbers, which can be withdrawn to let floods pass, and
can be manipulated to any extent so as to regulate the
amount of water passing. A familiar instance of a
movable weir is the one which is usually placed across
a mill stream, the wooden gates working in grooves in
the masonry.</p>

<p>Above a weir in Java, 162 feet long, there was a
great accumulation of shingle in the bed of the river,
and the head of a canal taking off above the weir
became choked. The crest of the weir on the side away
from the canal was raised 5¼ feet and the crest sloped
gradually down, a length of 43 feet on the side next
the canal remaining as it was. This was quite successful.
It was practically a contraction of the river near
the canal off-take, and this must have caused scour, so
that the bed became lower than the floor of the canal
head and the shingle was not carried in. The shingle,
however, is said to have been carried over the weir
(<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. clxv.).</p>

<p>A lock is an adjunct to a weir, used when navigation
has to be provided for. The lock may be placed close
to the weir or it may be in a side channel, the upstream
end of the lock being about in a line with the weir.
Locks have already been discussed in <a href="#Chap_IX_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>Frequently a “salmon ladder” has to be provided.
It consists of a series of steps or a zigzag arrangement
so that the velocity of the water is not too great for
the fish to ascend.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_2">2. <b>General Design of a Weir.</b>&mdash;Unless the bed
and sides of the channel are of rock, a weir has side
walls and rests on a strong floor or “apron.” These
need not extend far upstream, but must extend some
way downstream because of the scouring action of the
water.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> A common type of weir is shown in <a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>.
The downstream face is made sloping, so that the water
may not fall vertically and strike the floor below the
weir. The thickness and length of the floor depend on
the volume of water to be passed and on the height
which it will fall and on the nature of the soil, and are
generally matters of judgment, though rules regarding
them, applicable to certain special cases, are given in
the next article.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_32" src="images/fig_32.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32.</span></p></div>

<p>The upper corners of the weir should be rounded. This
prevents their being worn away; but the rounding of
the upstream corner has another advantage. If the
corner is sharp, the stream springs clear from it and the
weir holds up the water higher, especially in floods.
With small depths of water the difference is less, and it
vanishes when there is only a trickle of water. Thus a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
crest rounded on the upstream side holds up low-water
nearly as well as a sharp-edged crest, but lets floods
pass more freely. Any batter given to the upstream
face has a similar advantage. The rounding is of more
importance as the batter is less. For similar reasons,
the upstream wing walls should be splayed or even
curved so as to be tangential to the side wall, and not
built normally to the stream. These advantages are
sometimes lost sight of. The downstream walls are
splayed to reduce the swirl.</p>

<p>The body of the weir may be of rubble and the face-work
of dressed stone. In large weirs the stones are
sometimes dowelled together. Where, as in many parts
of India, stone is expensive, brick is used for small
weirs, the crest and faces being brick on edge.</p>

<p>Downstream of the floor, unless the channel is of
very hard material, there is paving or pitching of the
bed and pitching of the sides, and these may terminate
in a curtain wall. The bank pitching may be of any of
the kinds described in <a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>, and the bed
paving as described in <a href="#Chap_V_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 6</i></a>, but downstream
of a weir the eddying is continuous and the lap of the
water on the bank is ceaseless, and good methods are
necessary. Sometimes planking, laid over a wooden
framing or attached to piles, is used instead of paving
and pitching.</p>

<p>In case the height of a weir is great relatively to its
thickness, the danger of its being overturned must be
considered. To be safe against overturning, the resultant
of the pressure on the weir must pass through the
middle third of its base (see <a href="#fig_62">fig. 62</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_XIII"><span class="smcap">Chap. XIII.</span></a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33.</span></p></div>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_3">3. <b>Weirs on Sandy or Porous Soil.</b>&mdash;If the channel
is very soft or sandy the weir may be built on one or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
more lines of wells. The wells are not so much to
support the weir as to form a curtain and prevent
streams, due to the hydraulic gradient A E (<a href="#fig_33">fig.
33</a>), from forming under the structure and gradually
removing the soil. It is assumed in the case represented
by the figure that the maximum head occurs
when the downstream channel is dry. Any removal of
soil from under the weir may cause its destruction.
The wells should be as close together as possible, and
the spaces between them carefully filled up with brickwork
or concrete to as great a depth as possible, and
below that by piles. Instead of wells, lines of sheet
piling&mdash;cast-iron or wood&mdash;can be used. A good fit
should be made, but it is not necessary that the joints
should be absolutely water-tight. The object is to
flatten the hydraulic gradient by increasing the length
travelled by the water from B E to B L G H E. Of
course, no flattening occurs at a point where the curtain
is not water-tight, but if only small interstices exist,
none but small trickles of water can pass, and the
interstices will probably soon be choked up, just as the
sand in a filter bed becomes clogged and has to be
washed. In any case, no important stream could
develop otherwise than round the toe of the curtain.
It has been stated that when a curtain is water-tight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
the water follows the line B L M G H K E, but this
requires proof. Another plan is to cover the bed and
sides of the channel with a continuous sheet of concrete
extending upstream of the weir from B to D&mdash;thus
flattening the hydraulic gradient from A E to F E.
Instead of concrete, clay puddle can be used with
pitching over it. The choice between the different
methods depends largely on questions of cost and
facility of construction. It has been said that a certain
amount of leakage occurs under structures such as the
Okla weir (<i>Art. 4</i>), which nevertheless remains undamaged.
There have, however, been cases in which
failures of works have occurred, especially when there
has been a great difference between the water-levels of
the upstream and downstream reaches, from no other
apparent cause than the passage of water underneath
the works.</h3>

<p>Weirs in porous soils have been discussed by Bligh
(<i>Engineering News</i>, 29th December 1910), who gives
the following as safe hydraulic gradients (<i>s</i>) or ratio of
the greatest head A B to the length B E:&mdash;</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Fine silt and sand as in the Nile</td>
    <td>1 in 18</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fine micaceous sand as in Colorado and Himalayan rivers</td>
    <td>1 in 15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ordinary coarse sand</td>
    <td>1 in 12</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gravel and sand</td>
    <td>1 in  9</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Boulders, gravel and sand</td>
    <td>1 in  4 to 1 in 6</td>
  </tr></table>

<p>These figures are probably quite safe enough even for
the most important works and for those where the
heading up is constant. For small works or for
regulators (<i>Art. 5</i>) where the heading up is not constant,
steeper gradients are permissible. Much also depends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
on the condition of the water. If it contains much silt,
all interstices will probably become choked up. The
hydraulic gradient in the case of the Narora weir
across the Ganges was 1 in 11. The weir failed after
working for twenty years. It was rebuilt with a
gradient of 1 in 16. In the Zifta and Assiut regulators
on the Nile the gradients are 1 in 16·4 and 1 in 21.</p>

<p>Regarding the upward pressure on the floor due to
the hydrostatic pressure from the head A B, there is a
theory that the weight of a portion of the floor at any
point P should be able to balance the pressure due to
a head of water P R. This, supposing the masonry to
be twice as heavy as water, would give a thickness of
floor equal to half P R. According to Bligh, the
theoretical thickness ought, for safety, to be increased
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
by one-third. Practically the thickness need not, in
most cases, be made even so great as is given by the
theoretical rule. On canals in the Punjab it is certainly
less. Water passing through soil or fine sand does
not exert anything like the pressure which it exerts
when passing through a pipe. It acts in the same
manner as in a capillary tube. It is only in coarse
sand or gravel or boulders that water flows as in a pipe.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
If the tail water covers the floor, the weight of a portion
of floor is reduced by the weight of an equal volume of
water. If the foundation of any part of the floor is
higher than B E, the upward pressure on it is reduced
because the water has to force its way upwards through
the soil.</p>

<p>Bligh also states as an empirical rule that in order to
provide efficiently against scour the length of floor B E
should be 4/<i>s</i> √(H/13), where H is the maximum head A B;
and he points out that in a case where this length is
less&mdash;as it usually is&mdash;than that necessary to give a
hydraulic gradient of the requisite flatness, according to
the rule previously quoted, it is better to add an upstream
floor B D, which may be of puddle and therefore
cheap, than to add to the downstream floor a
length E C which must be of masonry or concrete, and
that this arrangement, by shifting the line of hydraulic
gradient from A E to F E, gives a reduced upward
pressure on the downstream floor.</p>

<p>The length E N to which pitching, if of “rip-rap”
type, should extend is given by Bligh as 10/<i>s</i> √(H/10) √(<i>q</i>/75),
where <i>q</i> is the maximum discharge in cubic feet per
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
second passing over a 1-foot length of the weir, and H
is the head A B.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_4">4. <b>Various Types of Weirs.</b>&mdash;The type of weir
shown in <a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a> may be varied by steepening or
flattening the slopes of one or both faces. Flattening
increases the cost but gives a greater spread for the
foundations. It may, however, be combined with a
decrease in the width of the crest. Flattening of the
downstream slope reduces the shock of the water on
the floor, but the slope itself, especially the lower
portion, has to stand a good deal of wear, and the
length exposed to this is increased. Flattening the
upstream slope facilitates the passage of floods. The
same result is obtained by making the crest slope
upwards (<a href="#fig_34">fig. 34</a>). In a small stream or in an
irrigation distributing channel, a weir may be a
simple brick wall with both faces vertical and corners
rounded.</h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span></p></div>

<p>Weirs in America are often built of crib-work filled
with stones. Weirs are also made of sheet piling filled
in with rubble, and the top may be protected by sheet
iron. A weir made on the Mersey in connection with
the Manchester Ship Canal works was so made. There
were three rows of piles and the filling in the back part
was of clay.</p>

<p>Sometimes the downstream faces of weirs used to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
made curved (<a href="#fig_35">figs. 35</a> and <a href="#fig_36">36</a>), the object being to
reduce the shock of the falling water, but the advantage
gained is not very appreciable, and this type of weir is
not very common.</p>

<p>The Okla weir (<a href="#fig_37">fig. 37</a>) across the river Jumna near
Delhi was built about thirty-eight years ago on the
river bed, which consisted of fine sand. The depth of
water over the crest in floods is 6 to 10 feet. The
material, except the face-work and the three walls, is
dry rubble.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_37" src="images/fig_37.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 37.</span></p></div>

<p>When the reach of channel downstream of a weir
has a bed-level much lower than that of the upstream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
reach&mdash;this is often the case in irrigation canals,&mdash;the
work is known as a “fall” or “rapid.” At a fall the
water generally drops vertically, and a cistern (<a href="#fig_38">fig. 38</a>)
is provided. The falling water strikes that in the
cistern and the shock on the floor is greatly reduced.
An empirical rule for the depth of the cistern, measured
from the bed of the downstream reach, is

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">K = H + ∛H √D,<br /></span>
</span></span>

where H is the depth of the crest of the fall below the
upstream water-level, and D is the difference between
the upstream and downstream water-levels. At some
old falls on Indian canals the water, as it begins to
fall into the cistern, is made to pass through a grating
which projects with an upward inclination from the
crest of the weir at the downstream angle. This splits
up the water and reduces the shock, but rubbish is
liable to collect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_38" src="images/fig_38.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 38.</span></p></div>

<p>In the usual modern type of canal fall in India the
weir has no raised crest, and the water is held up by
lateral contraction of the waterway just above the fall.
The opening through which the water passes is trapezoidal
(<a href="#fig_39">fig. 39</a>), being wide at the water-level and narrow
at the bed-level. In a small channel there is only one
opening, but in a large canal there are several side by
side, so that the water falls in several distinct streams.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
The curved lip shown in the plan is added to make the
water spread out and cause less shock to the floor.
The dimensions of the openings are calculated so that
however the supply in the canal may vary, there is
never any heading up or drawing down. The detailed
method of calculation for finding C F and the ratio of
A B to B C is given in <i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span> In
cases where it is only necessary for the notch to be
accurate when the depth of water ranges from B C to
three-fourths B C, it will suffice to calculate as follows:&mdash;Let
<i>b</i> be the bed width of the canal, and let Q be the
discharge and B the mean width of the stream when
the depth of water is B C. Decide on the number of
notches, and let W be the width of a notch calculated
as if it were to be rectangular, <i>i.e.</i> by the ordinary weir
formula. Increase the width to W´ = 1·05 W. Then
make the notch trapezoidal, keeping the mean width W´,
and making the bottom width <i>w</i> (or C F), such that
<i>w</i>/W´ = <i>b</i>/B. The top width of the notch is of course
increased as much as the bottom width is reduced.</p>

<p>A rapid has a long downstream slope, which is
expensive to construct and difficult to keep in repair,
especially as the canals can only be closed for short
periods. Rapids exist in large numbers on the Bari
Doab Canal in India, the face-work consisting in many
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
cases of rounded undressed boulders&mdash;with the interstices
filled up by spawls and concrete&mdash;which stand the
wear well. Rapids have again been used on the more
modern canals in places where boulders are obtainable,
and where deep foundations would have given trouble
in unwatering. The upstream face of a rapid is
vertical, or has a steep slope.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_5">5. <b>Weirs with Sluices.</b>&mdash;The long weirs built across
Indian rivers below the heads of irrigation canals
generally extend across the greater part of the river
bed. In the remaining part&mdash;generally the part nearest
the canal head&mdash;there is, instead of the weir, a set of
openings or “under-sluices” (<a href="#fig_40">fig. 40</a>) with piers having
iron grooves in which gates can slide vertically. The
piers may be twenty feet apart and five feet thick. The
gates are worked by one or more “travellers,” which
run on rails on the arched roadway. The traveller is
provided with screw gearing to start a gate which sticks.
When once started it is easily lifted by the ordinary
gears. The gates descend by their own weight. The
gate in each opening is usually in two halves, upper and
lower, each in its own grooves, and both can be lifted
clear of the floods. In intermediate stages of the river
these gates have to be worked a good deal. (See also
<a href="#Chap_V_Art_5"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 5.</i></a>) Usually the weir has, all along its
crest, a set of hinged shutters, which lie flat at all
seasons, except that of low water in the river.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 41.</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p></div>

<p>The canal head consists of smaller arched openings,
provided with gates working in vertical grooves and
lifted by a light traveller. If the floor of the canal
head is higher than the beds of the river and the canal,
it may be said to be a weir, but otherwise the canal head
is merely a set of sluices without a weir.</p>

<p>The barrage of the Nile at Assiut (<a href="#fig_41">fig. 41</a>), and the old
barrages of the Rosetta and Damietta branches, consist
of sets of sluices without weirs. At Assiut there are
piers five metres apart and gates working in grooves
like those, above described, at Indian headworks.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_42" src="images/fig_42.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span></p></div>

<p>The “dam” across the Ravi, at the head of the
Sidhnai Canal in the Punjab, also consists of sluice
openings without a weir. The piers are connected by
horizontal beams (<a href="#fig_42">fig. 42</a>), against which, and against a
sill at their lower ends, rest a number of nearly vertical
timber “needles,” fitting close together, which can be
removed when necessary by men standing on a foot-bridge.
In floods the needles are all removed and laid
on the high-level bridge (not shown in the drawing),
the foot-bridge being then submerged. With needles
the span between two piers can be greater than would be
possible with a gate. Needles can be used up to a length
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
of 12 or 14 feet, excluding the handle which projects above
the horizontal beam. They can be of pine, about 5 inches
deep in the direction of the stream, and 4 inches thick.</p>

<p>Where a branch takes off from a canal in India there
are usually no fixed weirs but two sets of piers&mdash;one in
the canal and one in the branch,&mdash;with openings and
gates like those at the canal heads, or else with wider
openings and needles. These works are called regulators.
The gates are worked by travellers or by fixed
windlasses or racks and pinions. Very small gates for
distributaries are often worked entirely by screw gearing.
For the smaller branches the gates are replaced
by sets of planks or timbers lying one above another
and removed by means of hooks. They are replaced by
means of the hooks or by being held in position some
little height above the water, and dropped. They are
finally closed up by ramming.</p>

<p>In the case of either planks or needles, leakage can be
much reduced by throwing shavings or chopped straw
into the water upstream of them.</p>

<p>Needles can be provided on their downstream sides
with eye-bolts just above the level of the beam against
which their upper ends rest. They can then be attached
by chains or cords to the beam or to the next pier, and
cannot be lost when released. They can be released by
a lever which can be inserted under the eye-bolt. By
pushing the head of a needle forward and inserting a
piece of wood under it, a little water can be let through.
In this way, or by removing needles here and there, the
discharge can be adjusted with exactness.</p>

<p>At a needle weir in an Indian canal all the needles in
one opening are reported to have broken simultaneously.
A possible explanation is that one needle broke and that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the velocity thus set up in the approaching stream
caused the others to break. On another occasion when
a canal was dry all the needles were blown down.</p>

<p>Sometimes the beam or bar against which the upper
ends of the needles rest is itself movable. At Ravenna,
in Italy, the bar between any two piers has a vertical
pivot at one pier and can swing horizontally. Its other
end is held by a prolongation of the next bar, near to
its pivot. If the end bar of the weir is released, each
bar in turn is released automatically.</p>

<p>At Teddington on the Thames the oblique weir, 480
feet long, has thirty-five gates, which extend over half
the length of the weir. They are worked by travellers
which run on a foot-bridge. The openings do not
extend down to the river bed, but are placed on the
top of a low weir. The other half of the weir is fixed.
The gates are raised to let floods pass.</p>

<p>At Richmond on the Thames the arrangements are
similar, the gates being counterbalanced to admit of easy
and rapid raising. When raised they are tilted into a
horizontal position so as not to obstruct the view.</p>

<p>In Stoney’s sluice gates a set of rollers is interposed
between the gate and the groove. The rollers are
suspended from a chain, one end of which is attached to
the top of the gate and the other end to the groove.
The rollers thus move up or down at half the rate of
the gate, and some of them are always in the proper
position for taking the pressure. Escape of water
between the gate and the groove is prevented by a rod
which is suspended on the upstream side of the gate
close to its end, and is pressed by the water against the
pier. Stoney’s sluice gates, with spans ranging up to
30 feet, have been used on the Manchester Ship Canal
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
for the sluices by which the water of the river Weaver
is passed across the canal, and at locks for passing the
flood waters of the Irwell and Mersey down the canal.
The gates are balanced by counterweights.</p>

<p>Frame weirs,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> used chiefly on rivers in France but
also in Belgium and Germany, are a modification of the
needle and plank arrangements above described. For
the masonry piers there are substituted iron frames or
trestles, which are hinged at the floor-level so that, when
the timbers have been removed, the frame can be turned
over sideways and lie flat on the floor, thus leaving the
waterway absolutely clear from side to side of the
stream. The foot-bridge which rests on the frames is
removed piece by piece. The frames are raised again
by means of chains attached to them. In order that
the frames may not be too heavy they are spaced 3 to
4 feet apart, or very much nearer than when masonry
piers are used. Horizontal planks can thus be used of
shorter lengths than the needles, and they can be made
up into greater widths so that the leakage is less.</p>

<p>A further modification consists in placing the bridge
platform above flood-level, and in hinging the frames to
it instead of to the floor. The frame turns about a
horizontal axis parallel to the length of the weir. A
weir of this kind can be used for greater depths of water
than the ordinary frame weir.</p>

<p>In some cases the horizontal planks are connected
together by hinges so that they form a “curtain.” The
curtain is raised by rolling it up by means of a traveller.
It admits of rapid and accurate adjustment of the water-level,
but there is considerable scouring action below a
curtain when it is somewhat raised.

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_6">6. <b>Falling Shutters.</b>&mdash;In Thénard’s system, first
used in France, a shutter (<a href="#fig_43">fig. 43</a>) is hinged at its lower
edge and is held up by a strut. When the lower end
of the strut is pushed aside it slides downstream and
the shutter falls flat. To enable the shutter to be
raised again an upstream shutter, which ordinarily lies
flat and is held down by a bolt, is released, and it is
then raised by the current to the extent permitted by
a chain attached to it. The downstream shutter is then
raised. Thénard’s system was not much used in France
because the river had to fall to a level somewhat too
low for navigation before the shutters could be raised.
The sudden jerk on the chain of the upstream shutter
is also liable to do damage. The system has been
adopted on some of the long weirs which cross Indian
rivers downstream of the heads of irrigation canals.
To prevent damage by shock, a hydraulic brake was
designed by Fouracres. It consists of a piston which
travels along a cylinder and drives water out through
small holes. The shutters are placed on the top of the
fixed weir, where they usually lie flat, except in the low
water season, any adjustments of the river discharge
being effected by means of the under-sluices.</h3>

<p>In the Chanoine system of falling shutters (<a href="#fig_44">fig. 44</a>),
used first in France, the shutter is hinged at a point
rather higher than the centre of pressure. The hinge
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
is supported by a vertical trestle, which is hinged at its
lower end and is supported by a strut which slides in a
groove and rests against a stop. When the water rises
to a certain height above the top of the shutter, it is
turned by the force of the water into a horizontal
position. The struts can then be pushed sideways out
of the stops by means of a “tripping bar,” which lies
along the floor parallel to the line of shutters and is
worked from the bank. The struts, trestles, and
shutters then fall flat. To close the weir the shutters
are first raised into the horizontal position which they
occupied before falling, by means of a hook worked
from a boat or by chains attached to a foot-bridge
running across the river upstream of the weir. They
can then be easily closed by a boat-hook. The water
closes them of itself if it falls low enough.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_44" src="images/fig_44.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44.</span></p></div>

<p>When the shutters fall a great rush of water occurs.
To obviate this a valve is made in the upper half of
the shutter. It consists of a miniature shutter on the
same principle as the main shutter. The pivot of the
main shutter is made at such a height that the shutter
will not turn over when only a small depth of water
flows over it. Instead of this the valve comes into
operation. The valve also facilitates the raising of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
shutter. Again, instead of the tripping bar, which
would sometimes have to be of great length or be liable
to damage owing to stones jamming in its teeth, the
shutter can be released by pulling the strut upstream
so that it falls into a second groove, down which it
slides. When a tripping bar is used, its teeth can be so
arranged that the shutters are released a few at a time,
first singly, then in twos and threes. Sometimes there are
gaps of a few inches between one shutter and the next,
and the gaps can be closed by needles if necessary.</p>

<p>Chanoine shutters can be very rapidly lowered, and
they are used in France and in the U.S.A. in places
where sudden floods occur. They are also used for
navigation “passes” where most of the heavy traffic is
downstream and where it is too heavy to be dealt with
in a lock. A foot-bridge across the stream or across
the navigation pass is always an assistance, but sometimes
it cannot be used when there is much floating
rubbish or ice. With a foot-bridge the cost is greater
than that of a needle weir.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_45" src="images/fig_45.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45.</span></p></div>

<p>In the Bear Trap weir (<a href="#fig_45">fig. 45</a>) the upstream shutter
rests against the downstream one. Both are raised by
admitting water from the upper reach, by means of a
culvert, through an opening in the side wall, and they
are made to fall by placing this opening in communication
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
with the downstream instead of the upstream
reach. This kind of shutter is only suitable for passes
of moderate width, and it is rather expensive on account
of the culverts.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>Shutters with fixed supports are used on the Irwell
and Mersey. A fixed frame is built across the stream
(<a href="#fig_46">fig. 46</a>) and the shutters are hinged to it. When the
water rises to a certain height above its top, the shutter
turns into a horizontal position, but as this causes a
severe rush of water the shutter is usually raised by a
chain attached to its lower end and worked from the
bank. When in a horizontal position, it is held there by
a ratchet. When the stream falls the ratchet is released
and the shutter is closed by the stream. This kind of
shutter cannot be used where there is navigation.</p>

<p>On the weir 4000 feet long across the river Chenab
at Khanki in the Punjab, the falling shutters, 6 feet
high and 3 feet wide, are hinged at the base and held
up by a tie-rod on the upstream side. The trigger
which releases the rod is actuated by means of a wire
rope carrying a steel ball, and worked by a winch from
the abutment of the weir or from one of the piers,
which are 500 feet apart. A winch is fixed on the
top of each pier, and communication with the piers is
effected by means of a cradle slung from a steel wire
rope, which rests on standards and runs across the weir.
The wire rope which carries the steel ball passes over a
series of forks, one on each shutter. When one trigger
has been released, that shutter falls and the ball hangs
loose. A further haul on the rope causes it to actuate
the trigger of the next shutter, and so on. If it is
desired to drop only some of the shutters, the rope is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
passed over the forks of those shutters only. The
shutters can be raised by means of a crane which runs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
along the weir on rails downstream of the shutters or,
if the water is too high to allow of this, by a crane in
the stern of a boat which is moored upstream of the
weir and allowed to drop down.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_7">7. <b>Adjustable Weirs.</b>&mdash;Drum weirs, invented by
Desfontaines, have been used in France and Germany.
Two paddles (<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47</a>) are fixed on a horizontal axis and
can turn through about 90°, the lower paddle, which
should be slightly the larger, working in a “drum,”
which is roofed over and can, by means of sluices, be
placed in communication with either the upper or lower
reach of the stream. According as the upper paddle is
to be raised or lowered, water is admitted from the
upper reach above or below the lower paddle, the water
on its other side being at the same time placed in communication
with the lower reach. On the weirs first
made on the Marne, the height of the upper paddle was
3 feet 7½ inches, and there were, in a weir, a number of
pairs of paddles, each being 4 feet 11 inches wide. By
having sluices at both abutments communicating with
both reaches, and by opening or closing each of them
more or less, the various paddles can be made to take up
different positions, and thus perfect control over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
discharge is obtained by simply turning a handle to
control a sluice gate. A weir has since been made with
a single pair of paddles extending right across the
opening (33 feet), and the height of the upper paddle is
over 9 feet.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></h3>

<p>The chief objection to drum weirs is the necessity for the
hollow or drum, which renders the work very expensive,
except when only a small depth of water is held up.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_48" src="images/fig_48.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48.</span></p></div>

<p>The old sluice gates of the Nile barrages were made
segmental (<a href="#fig_48">fig. 48</a>), turned on pivots in the piers,
and were raised by chains.</p>

<p>In some factories in Bavaria and Switzerland there
are self-acting shutters which revolve on a horizontal
axis at the lower edge, and are counterbalanced by
cylindrical weights which roll on ways in the side wall.
This arrangement is suitable when there is only one span,
which can, however, be as great as 30 feet. An adjustable
weir used at Schweinfurt on the Maine, consists of
a hollow iron cylinder, 59 feet long and 10 feet in
diameter, running across the stream. The cylinder is
pear-shaped in cross-sections, and can be made, by
means of mechanism, to revolve, the water passing over
it. Another kind used at Mulhausen on the Rhine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
consists of a hollow iron cylinder 85 feet long and 9·8
feet in diameter. The whole cylinder can be raised by
winches (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vols. cliii. and clvi.).</p>

<h3 id="Chap_X_Art_8">8. <b>Remarks on Sluices.</b>&mdash;In all kinds of sluice
openings or regulators, the principles of design as regards
protection of the bed and sides, splaying and curving
of walls and piers, thickness of floor, and prevention of
the formation of streams under the structure are the
same as laid down for weirs.</h3>

<p>In order that a pier may be safe from being overturned
by the pressure of the water when the gates or
timbers are down, the resultant of its weight, including
that of anything resting on it, and of the water pressure
on it, must pass through the middle third of its length.
This generally occurs when there is an arched roadway.
Otherwise it must be arranged for by prolonging the
base of the piers downstream, and giving the downstream
side a batter or steps.</p>

<p>The floor should usually be placed at a level somewhat
lower than the mean bed-level of the stream.
The bed may possibly be lowered in course of time.
Lowering the floor also gives a greater thickness of
water cushion to take the shock of water falling over
the gates or planks. It is convenient to build, on the
floor, a low wall or sill, reaching up to the level of the
bed or thereabouts, and running across from pier to
pier under the line of gates or needles. The height of
the gates or needles can thus be reduced, and there is
little chance of silt or stones collecting and interfering
with them. In the case of needles the wall must be
strong enough to resist their horizontal pressure. If
ever the bed is lowered, the wall can easily be cut down
or removed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span></p>

<p>Sluices with gates are, of course, used in connection
with works other than weirs or regulators, as, for
instance, in reservoirs or locks, or generally for communication
between any two bodies of water. The
gate may or may not be wholly submerged. If it is
not wholly submerged, planks can be used. Needles
can be used if the flow is always in one direction and
never in the reverse direction. In all cases protection
downstream of the opening is required.</p>

<p>In designing a set of sluice openings or regulators, it
is sometimes the custom to make the total area of waterway
the same as that of the stream in its unobstructed
condition. There is no particular reason why it should
be the same. In a description of the Assiut Barrage
(<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. clviii., p. 30), it is mentioned
that one of the reasons for placing the floor lower than
the river bed was that the width of the waterway of
the barrage was less than that of the river. The bed
has to be heavily protected in any case, and the proper
principle is to fix a velocity which is considered to
be safe and, the maximum discharge being known, to
determine the area of the waterway accordingly. In
the case of a very wide river like the Nile, with a well-defined
channel, it is inconvenient to make the distance
between the abutments of a work much less than the
width of the channel, but so far as velocity is concerned,
the floor need not usually be lower than the bed. The
protection given to the channel on the upstream side
of the barrage (<a href="#fig_41">fig. 41</a>) seems to be rather greater than
necessary. The thickness of the floor (9 feet 10 inches)
seems excessive. The thickness originally proposed
was much less.</p>

<p>Of the many kinds of apparatus described in this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
chapter each possesses some advantages and disadvantages.
Gates require a bridge with powerful lifting
apparatus, and are suitable for large bodies of water and
great depths. Comparing needles with planks, the
former can be worked by one man and admit of rapid
removal, and require far fewer piers. Planks require
two men, and are sometimes liable to jam, but obstruct
floating rubbish less than needles, and in shallow water
give rise to less leakage. Whether needles or planks
are used, masonry piers are most suitable where sand or
gravel are liable to accumulate on the floor, or where
there is much floating rubbish. The hinged frames
are suitable in other cases. Falling shutters of the
Chanoine type admit of very rapid lowering, and can
be used without a foot-bridge. The drum weir is
perfect in action, but its cost is high.</p>

<p>At any system of sluices the regulation should be so
arranged as to minimise the chances of damage to the
bed and banks where this is at all likely to occur. If
the gates are opened only near one side of the structure,
there will be a rush of water on that side, and serious
damage may occur. The opening should be done
symmetrically and, as far as possible, distributed along
the whole length.</p>

<p>Until experience has shown it to be unnecessary,
soundings should be taken at regular periods of time
downstream of every important work where scour can
occur. When scour is found to have occurred at any
particular part of the work, the rush of water at such
places should, as far as possible, be prevented, and a
chance given for silting to occur.</p>

<p>Unless experience shows that damage is not likely to
occur, a stock of concrete blocks, sandbags, or other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
suitable materials should be kept on the spot ready for
use. Life-buoys should be provided on any work where
large volumes of water are dealt with, especially if it is
unfenced in any part, or if any of the men employed
are casual workers.</p>

<p>Regarding works for preventing a river from shifting
its course so as to damage or destroy a weir or similar
work, see <a href="#Chap_XI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>, <i>Art. 3.</i></a>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="large">BRIDGES AND SYPHONS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_XI_Art_1">1. <b>Bridges.</b>&mdash;Bridges are of many kinds. In this book
only those parts of them are considered which are
exposed to the stream. If a bridge has piers, there must
be some disturbance of the water. The disturbance will
be least when the area of the waterway of the bridge is
at least as great as that of the stream, and when its
shape is as nearly as possible the same. For small
streams, a single span clearing the whole stream may be
adopted, especially when the channel is of soft material,
but for a large stream the cost of intermediate piers,
even with a certain amount of protection for them or
with deep foundations, will be more than counterbalanced
by the smaller thickness of arch or depth of girder.</h3>

<p>Generally a bridge has vertical abutments which limit
the waterway, but it may have land-spans, and in this
case the stream as it rises can spread out. Piers and
abutments should be so designed that abrupt changes in
the section of the stream are, as far as possible, avoided,
the piers being rounded or boat-shaped at both ends
and the abutments suitably curved (<a href="#fig_49">fig. 49</a>). Boat-shaped
piers, besides presenting the neatest appearance,
cause the least amount of disturbance.</p>

<p>A bridge can be made safe against scour either by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
giving deep foundations to the piers and abutments
or by adding a floor and, if necessary, pitching. The
former course is usually adopted and is the best. But
in a case in which the discharge of a stream is to be
increased or has been underestimated, it is often far
easier to add a floor to an existing bridge than to increase
the span of the bridge. In order to increase the
waterway the floor can be “dished,” <i>i.e.</i> made at a level
lower than the bed of the stream<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and gradually sloped
up&mdash;the slopes being pitched&mdash;both upstream and
downstream of the bridge, to meet the bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_49" src="images/fig_49.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49.</span></p></div>

<p>In any case in which the water rises above the crown
of the arch, the bridge becomes a syphon, and a floor
is probably necessary unless the foundations are very
deep, or unless the rise of water above the crown is
temporary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_50" src="images/fig_50.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 50.</span></p></div>

<p>In the case of Indian rivers which have soft channels,
and are ordinarily of moderate width but are subject
to occasional floods when the width of the stream is
multiplied several times and becomes very great, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
the rule to make the span of a railway bridge far less
than this greater width. The stream during floods
scours out a deep channel through the bridge with great
rapidity, and no heading up worth mentioning occurs.
The foundations of the piers are very deep, being
frequently 50 feet below the lowest point of the river
bed which can be found anywhere within several miles
of the bridge. The span of the bridge can be arrived
at by considering a general cross-section of the river as
it is when in high flood, and assuming that scour to the
depth of the lowest point, found as just explained, will
take place in one-third of the span of the bridge. The
span can then be so fixed as to give no heading up. It
is not assumed that there will be no increase in velocity
through the bridge. The velocity in the deep scoured
portions will be increased. The piers are protected by
loose stone (<a href="#fig_50">fig. 50</a>). The spans vary from 100 to 250
feet. The bridge over the river Chenab at Wazirabad had
originally sixty-four spans of 145 feet each. The number
of spans has since been reduced to twenty-eight. With
a very long bridge, the current of the shifting stream is
more likely to strike the bridge obliquely, though this is
not the chief reason for reducing the length. Long
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
spans, say 250 feet, have been found to be better than
shorter spans; the cost of the stone protection round the
piers is of course less (<i>Government of India Technical
Paper</i>, No. 153, “River Training and Control on the
Guide Bank System,” by Sir F. J. E. Spring, C.I.E.,
1904).</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XI_Art_2">2. <b>Syphons and Culverts.</b>&mdash;Syphons are used to
pass drainage channels or other streams under canals
or other lines of communication. In the case of a
masonry syphon under a stream which may be dry
while the syphon is full, the weight of the arch and its
solid load must be not less than the upward pressure of
the water passing through the syphon. The channel
sometimes has a vertical drop at the upstream side
(<a href="#fig_51">fig. 51</a>) and a slope at the downstream side. The
slope enables any solid materials to be carried through,
and facilitates cleaning out and unwatering. The drop
at the upstream side does not give rise to any shock on
the floor when the syphon is full, but a slope is preferable
if there is room for it, and it causes less loss of
head.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_51" src="images/fig_51.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span></p></div>

<p>A culvert which is liable to run full and which
has a steep approach channel (<a href="#fig_52">fig. 52</a>) may become
suddenly drowned on the upstream side. As soon
as the water rises to the crown of the arch, the
wet border of the culvert increases and this reduces
the velocity and discharge. The water coming
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
down the approach channel then rises abruptly,
and the increased section of the stream causes
a reduced velocity of approach, and this further
reduces the discharge through the culvert. The
heading up continues until the difference in the upstream
and downstream water-levels is great enough
to readjust matters (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol.
clxxxvi.). The possibility of this heading up occurring
should be attended to in the design. In the case of a
culvert in a railway embankment where heavy floods
have to be passed, the culvert may be made bell-mouthed
by a curved embankment constructed on
its upstream side.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_52" src="images/fig_52.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 52.</span></p></div>

<h3 id="Chap_XI_Art_3">3. <b>Training Works.</b>&mdash;The object of the upstream
and downstream protections already described (<a href="#CHAPTER_X"><span class="smcap">Chap.
X.</span></a>) is to prevent damage to the structure owing to the
disturbance caused by the structure itself. When a
river is given to shifting its course (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_9"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 9</i></a>)
and cutting away its banks, protection of another kind is
required. The stream, if left to itself, may cut away
one bank upstream of the structure for a long distance,
and eventually damage, or destroy by undermining, the
upstream pitching and the abutment itself. This is
known as outflanking. If in the neighbourhood of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
line A B (<a href="#fig_53">fig. 53</a>) there is nothing for the river to
damage,&mdash;if, for instance, the structure is a weir with a
canal, if any, only on the opposite bank of the river,&mdash;and
if the land is of no particular value, the case could
conceivably be met by protecting the abutment on
all sides, but even then there might be a chance of
the erosion of the bank continuing until the stream
had formed a connection at C with the downstream
reach. This, of course, in the case of a weir, would
render the work useless and might even destroy it.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_53" src="images/fig_53.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span></p></div>

<p>In the case of a bridge carrying a
road or railway, or of a syphon or
aqueduct carrying a canal or other
stream, it is wholly inadmissible to
allow the stream to cut away even as
far as the point A for fear of its
severing the line of communication.
Thus in every case it is practically
necessary to prevent any serious
erosion of the bank upstream of the
structure. In ordinary cases it is sufficient to protect
the bank C D by any of the methods given in <a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap.
VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>, the protection being turned inwards, as
shown at D, to prevent the end of it being damaged.</p>

<p>In the case of railway bridges across the great
shifting rivers of India, protection used at one time to
be afforded by various systems of spurs. This has now
been abandoned in favour of Bell’s guide banks
(<a href="#fig_54">fig. 54</a>), which are found to be far more satisfactory.
These guide banks are discussed in the paper by Spring
quoted above (<i>Art. 1</i>). The spaces behind the guide
banks become filled with water, at least during floods,
and are meant to be silted up. An opening in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
railway embankment should be provided at A, and
another on the opposite side of the river, to ensure a
constant flow of water (<a href="#Chap_V_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>), but they
should not be large enough to cause high velocity.
The chief danger to which a guide bank is liable is
outflanking when the stream assumes the position
shown. To guard against this danger it is necessary
to have very strong and massive heads to the guide
banks. When the bank of the eroding stream, downstream
of the guide bank head, becomes a semicircle or
thereabouts, the stream takes a short-cut across the
sandbank, and to encourage this an artificial cut can be
dug, at the season of low water, on any suitable line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_54" src="images/fig_54.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 54.</span></p></div>

<p>If the guide banks were made with an increased
width of opening at the upper end, this would reduce
the chance of outflanking but would increase the danger
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
from a direct attack such as indicated, in the figure, on
the left bank. It has been suggested that the width at
the upstream end should be less than at the bridge, but
this seems undesirable. Probably the form shown in
<a href="#fig_54">fig. 54</a> is the proper one. The length of the guide bank
upstream of the bridge is made about equal to the span
of the bridge between the two guide banks. If made
less than this, the river might cut into the line of
railway. The length of guide bank downstream of the
bridge is generally 300 to 500 feet, being greater as the
velocity of the river is greater and the sand of its bed
finer.</p>

<p>The Bengal Dooars Railway runs near the foot of
the Bhutan Himalayas, and crosses some broad river
channels which, after the excessively heavy rains which
occur, are filled by streams of very high velocities.
One such channel or set of channels (<a href="#fig_55">fig. 55</a>), more than
half a mile wide, is provided with a bridge whose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
waterway consists of ten spans of 60 feet each. The
railway embankment across the remainder of the
channel having been breached in many places in 1903,
protection was afforded by T-headed spurs and other
groynes, the first arrangement, which withstood the
floods of 1904, being as shown in the figure. The
triangular apex of the A-shaped groyne, south-east of
the bridge, was added in 1905 because, in its absence,
the water struck the bridge obliquely. After the
addition there was a great deposit of silt in the
neighbourhood of the four T-headed spurs. Next year
the river, in a great flood, rose over the top of the
railway embankment near these spurs, and finally caused
a breach 600 feet wide. The embankment was afterwards
raised. The velocity through the bridge seems
to have approached 18 feet per second. The bridge
had at first no floor. A floor was added, but was much
damaged by the floods (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol.
clxxiii.). The level of the floor is not given, but it
would seem to have been desirable to make it at a very
low level. The rising of the stream over the railway
embankment was attributed to the silting up near the
T-headed spurs. The addition of the triangular portion
above referred to would seem to have somewhat assisted
this process. If all the trouble could have been foreseen,
it might have been best to build an additional
bridge 2000 feet south-east of the existing bridge.
The groynes were composed of the wire-network rolls,
described in <a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>, piled pyramid fashion.

<p>In England, land near a stream or flooded area is
said to be “awash” when the flood water rises to
within 3 feet of the surface of the ground. The
drainage of such land is apt to be unsatisfactory. If
land is flooded or awash, it may be desirable to shift
the outfall of a branch drain to a point lower down in
the main outfall.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XII_Art_2">2. <b>Small Streams.</b>&mdash;In dealing with small streams,
such as branch drains or natural streams not far from
their sources, the engineer is concerned only with their
maximum discharges. He has to design culverts,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
bridges or syphons to pass the streams under roads or
other works, or to design channels or waste weirs for
them. In a settled country there may be already some
works in existence on the same stream, and these may
form a guide, or it may be possible to obtain local
information as to the height or volume of floods. Even
in such a case rainfall figures will be most useful. In
districts where there is no settled population, and in
any case where the stream is ill-defined, and the flow
fitful, the rainfall figures may afford the only, or at
least far the best, means of estimating the discharge.</h3>

<p>The rainfall to be considered in all these cases is the
maximum likely to fall in a short period of time. The
catchment areas dealt with are small, say 5 square
miles or less. It must be assumed that the fall of rain
extends to all parts of the catchment area, and that its
duration is sufficient for the water from all parts of it
to reach the site of the work. The different valleys or
divisions of the catchment area should be considered
separately, and regard must be had, not only to the
area of each division, but to its length and declivity
measured along the course of the stream which drains
it. On these two factors depend the time taken by the
rain water to reach the site of the work. The rate at
which the rain water flows over the ground into rills or
small subsidiary streams may be taken to be ¼ mile per
hour in flat land, and 1 mile per hour on steep hill
sides. The velocity of the current in the rills and
larger streams is generally 2 to 4 miles per hour. It
can, when necessary, be calculated roughly from the
size and slope of the stream. To be on the safe side,
the highest probable figure can be taken.</p>

<p>The time taken by the water to flow from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
furthest points of the catchment area to the site of the
work having been arrived at as above, the next thing is
to estimate the probable maximum intensity of the
rainfall during that time over the whole catchment area.
The only figures immediately available will be the
mean annual rainfall, or perhaps the maximum fall in
twenty-four hours, but it has been shown (<a href="#Chap_II_Art_5"><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>,
<i>Art. 5</i></a>) how the probable maximum fall over a shorter
period may be estimated.</p>

<p>The next thing to be calculated is the “run-off,” <i>i.e.</i>
the probable proportion of the rainfall which will at
once run off. This may be less than the proportion
which will eventually become “available,” because some
of it may go to feed the underground supply from
which springs are fed. The proportion running off a
small area in a short time would, under most circumstances,
be rather difficult to estimate, but in the case
under consideration, only the probable maximum figure
is required. This occurs when the ground is saturated.
Under these circumstances the ratio of the run-off to
the total fall may be somewhat as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The figures can be increased when the surface is
specially hard or frozen, and decreased when it is soft,
sandy, covered with woods or vegetation, or cultivated.</p>

<p>Whether or not the above procedure is necessary in
its entirety depends chiefly on the size of the proposed
work and on the degree of inconvenience likely to
arise from any wrong estimation of the discharge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>In designing syphons to carry torrents across the
Upper Jhelum Canal in the Punjab, the discharge from
a catchment area of ·79 square miles was found to be
about 4000 cubic feet per second. This is at the rate of
about 5000 cubic feet per second per square mile, and is
equivalent to a run-off of 7·8 inches in an hour. The
catchment area was among low hills, not far from the
Himalayas, and the declivities of the rills were very
steep. The superintending engineer, Mr R. E. Purves,
states<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> that the discharge observations were reliable,
and that falls of rain of an inch in ten minutes occur
not infrequently, even though the fall in twenty-four
hours might not exceed 2 or 3 inches. In order to
account for the discharge in the case under consideration,
it would at first seem to be necessary to assume
not only that a fall at the rate of 7·8 inches per hour
had occurred, but that the whole of it had run off. It
is not, however, necessary to assume quite so much.
The ground being saturated, the rain falling in a period
of five minutes might be reaching the discharge site
with little loss. A suddenly increased fall at the rate
of 6 inches per hour might then occur, and the water
travelling more quickly and with hardly any loss, would
overtake that already passing the site. This case seems
to show that for a very small catchment area the whole
of the fall, and more, must be allowed for.</p>

<p>The Chief Engineer of the Punjab did not accept
the above figures.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> He remarked that observations
taken under great difficulties as to time and place
are liable to error, and he considered that an allowance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of rainfall at the rate of 4·8 inches per hour&mdash;a
rate which had been observed elsewhere&mdash;and a
run-off of ·75 of the fall would be sufficient. He
accepted a discharge of 2000 cubic feet per second for
catchment areas of less than 5 square miles, assuming
the run-off to be ·75 of the fall, but afterwards increased
the figure to 2400 cubic feet per second. The chief
engineer did not overlook the fact that in the designs
for the drainage aqueducts a free-board of 5 feet had
been allowed, and perhaps this led to an acceptance
of an estimated discharge less than would otherwise
have been accepted. It does not seem to be at all
certain that the figure put forward by Mr Purves
was far wrong. When the original project estimate
for the Upper Jhelum Canal was framed, the irrigation
engineers had had no experience of small and steep
catchments, and no one had suspected that the discharge
per square mile would be anything like the
above. The sums of money provided for works for the
passages of torrents had to be increased in ratios varying
from 2·5 to 1 to 6 to 1.</p>

<p>In the south-east of New South Wales flood discharges
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
of 135 and 84 cubic feet per second have been

<h3 id="Chap_XII_Art_3">3. <b>Rivers.</b>&mdash;It is possible to apply the methods of
the preceding article to large catchment areas, but the

table shows some figures based on actual flood discharges.
None of the localities have excessive rainfalls, though
most are liable to occasional very heavy falls. In

<p>The tendency of the figures in column 5 of the table
is to decrease as the catchment area increases. This
tendency has long been known, and attempts have
been made to found on it formulæ for calculating
flood discharges. One such formula is Q = <i>c</i> M<sup>&frac34;</sup>
where Q is the flood discharge in cubic feet per
second and M is the area of the catchment in square
miles. The formula is roughly correct, <i>c</i> being
a constant for catchment areas of not dissimilar
characters and with rainfalls not differing much. But
for other cases there is no knowing how <i>c</i> may
vary, and this renders the formula practically useless.
The author of another such formula quotes cases
Nos. 5 and 8 in the above table, and the two cases
mentioned at the end of <i>Art. 2</i> as agreeing fairly
well with the result of his formula. The tendency
just mentioned is due to the fact that every river
is composed of tributaries which have their own
small catchment areas but are, when measured to the
general outlet or point where the discharge is under
consideration, of very different lengths, to the improbability
of heavy rainfall occurring over all these
small areas at such times as to cause the different flood
waves to arrive simultaneously at the outlet, and to the
facts that in the case of the longer tributaries the flood
waves flatten out (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>, <i>Arts. 3</i> and
<i>4</i>) so as to arrive more gradually, and that, unless rain
is also falling all along their courses, these longer
tributaries undergo losses from evaporation and absorption.
But occasionally it happens that the various flood
waves do arrive at the outlet more or less simultaneously,
and that the rainfall continues so long and is so widely
distributed&mdash;though not necessarily of the same intensity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
as that which caused the flood&mdash;that the flood waves do
not flatten out and that losses in the channels do not
occur. Floods can thus vary to an extraordinary degree
in severity, and formulæ are quite useless. This is why
floods occur surpassing all previous records, as, for
instance, the recent floods in Paris. However severe a
flood may be, it can never be said that the maximum
has, even probably, been attained unless it can be shown
that the rainfall has been so heavy, so long continued,
and so distributed that anything worse is not likely
to occur.</p>

<p>The best method of estimating the flood discharge of
a large perennial stream is to ascertain, by local inquiry,
the height to which it is known to have risen, and to
take cross-sections of the channel and calculate the
discharge (<a href="#Chap_III_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>, <i>Arts. 4</i></a> and <a href="#Chap_III_Art_5"><i>5</i></a>). In designing
works, allowance can be made for a flood exceeding any
known before. This method applies also to a case in
which a river is formed by the junction of two or more
large tributaries. It is possible that the tributaries
have not, within the memory of man, been in high flood
simultaneously. If so, the chances of this occurring are
no greater and no less than if the stream was composed
merely of a number of small affluents. Remarks
regarding intermittent streams are given in <a href="#Chap_III_Art_7"><span class="smcap">Chap. III.</span>,
<i>Art. 7</i></a>.</p>

<p>Since an acre contains 43,560 square feet, and a twelfth
of this is 3630, it follows that a fall of 4 inches of rain,
of which 1 inch runs off, in an hour, gives a discharge
of 3630 cubic feet per hour, or about 1 cubic foot per
second. This is 640 cubic feet per second for a square
mile. The figures in column 5 of the above table show
that the run-off was, in the cases quoted, generally far
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
less than 1 inch. In case No. 4 it was 1 inch, and in
case No. 2 it was &frac34; inch.</p>

<p>In the case of the Kali Nadi (No. 9 in the table) an
aqueduct to carry the Lower Ganges Canal over the
stream was being designed. The flood discharge,
estimated from the supposed flood-level and cross-section
of the stream was (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. xcv.)
26,352 cubic feet per second. The discharge, estimated
by assuming a fall of 6 inches of rain in twenty-four
hours over the catchment area&mdash;then believed to be
3025 square miles&mdash;and a run-off of ·25 of the fall, was
114,950 cubic feet per second. This figure was rejected
on the ground that the rainfall would not be continuous
over so large an area as 3025 square miles. An allowance
of 7 cubic feet per second per square mile was
made and, a fresh survey having shown that the catchment
area was only 2593 square miles, a discharge of
18,000 cubic feet per second was allowed for. The
aqueduct was built, about the year 1875, with five
arched spans of 35 feet each, the total area of the
waterway being about 3000 square feet. The length
of the piers and abutments was 212 feet, the width of
the canal carried over the aqueduct being 192 feet. In
1884 the aqueduct was partly destroyed by a flood
whose discharge was about 44,000 cubic feet per second.
In July 1885 it was wholly destroyed by a flood whose
discharge was estimated at 132,475 cubic feet per second,
but was probably more. The discharge must have been
more than 51 cubic feet per second per square mile.
The aqueduct was rebuilt with a waterway of about
15,000 square feet. Below the aqueduct there was a
bridge which had been standing for a hundred years.
Its waterway was only 1146 square feet. It was not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
much damaged by the flood of 1884, but much of the
water passed round it, breaking through the embanked
roadway or pouring over it. It is understood that the
bridge was destroyed by the flood of 1885.</p>

<p>This case shows the necessity for making every
possible allowance in calculating flood discharges for
important works. The smallness of the discharge, as
calculated from the cross-section of the stream, was
probably owing to its being dry when the survey was
made, so that the velocity could not be observed,
but it is probable that such a discharge as wrecked
the aqueduct had never before passed down the
stream.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XII_Art_4">4. <b>Prediction of Floods.</b>&mdash;At any place high up
on the course of a stream, the occurrence of a flood can
often be predicted when rain storms&mdash;often accompanied
in the tropics by lightning&mdash;can be seen to be occurring
towards the sources of the stream. For any station
lower down the stream and for precise information in
any case, the readings of gauges higher up the stream
can be telegraphed. If the station is at a great distance
from the gauge and if there is railway communication,
the readings can be sent by post.</h3>

<p>In order to be able to predict the time of the arrival
of a flood at the lower station the reading of a gauge
there, and also of that at the upper station, should be
taken at frequent intervals. In the case of large rivers
and distances of hundreds of miles, the interval may be
six or even twelve hours, but in other cases it should be
much less. If the readings are plotted, as in <a href="#fig_56">fig. 56</a>,
oblique lines can be drawn to connect the saliences and
depressions, and the time taken by each change can thus
be readily seen. When the upper part of the stream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
is formed by two or more important tributaries there
should be a gauge in each.</p>

<p>As to what constitutes a flood, the gauge diagram of
a river (<a href="#fig_56">fig. 56</a>) is generally such that a line can be
sketched as shown dotted. The rises above this line
are floods. The maximum flood discharge of a Northern
Indian river is estimated roughly as being 100 times
the low-water discharge. Leslie’s rule for floods in the
British Isles is that if all the daily discharges of a
stream during the year are ranged in order of magnitude,
the discharges of the upper quarter are considered
to be floods.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_56" src="images/fig_56.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 56.</span></p></div>

<p>In India it is sometimes arranged that a telegram
shall, in the low-water stage of the river, be sent from
the upper station when a rise of 2 feet occurs in
twenty-four hours or any less period, with a further
telegram for any such subsequent rise. The telegram
states the exact reading on the gauge and whether the
water is rising steady or falling. This is given as
indicating the procedure that may be followed where
the telegraph has to be used, but when long and
frequent telegrams are not desirable.</p>

<p>The advancing end of a flood wave may, while the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
wave is rising and being formed, travel rapidly, but
when the wave has been formed it travels at the
ordinary rate of flow of the risen stream. The advancing
end of a trough may, while it is being formed,
travel rapidly, but after formation it travels at the
ordinary rate of the fallen stream (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap.
IX.</span>, <i>Arts. 3</i> and <i>4</i>). Thus the rate at which a change in
water-level travels down a stream depends at first on
the amount of the rise or fall, but afterwards on the
water-level of the risen or fallen stream.</p>

<p>By taking the above facts into consideration and
noting the actual times obtained from the diagram, it
will be possible to arrive at the probable time that will
be taken by any change. It will also be possible to
predict the height of the flood. If it is worth while,
an empirical formula can be got out. If there are
tributaries, each with a gauge, the matter will be more
difficult. Probably the floods in the tributaries will
arrive at different times, but even in such cases empirical
formulæ have been arrived at, especially in France, and
are mentioned in various volumes of the Proceedings of
the Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>

<p>In all cases predictions are liable to be more or less
upset if rain falls in the tract between the upper and
lower gauges. In very dry weather the speed of a
flood wave may be somewhat reduced, and the height to
which it rises will almost certainly be reduced.</p>

<p>The full effect of a change will not be felt at the
lower station unless the change at the upper station is
maintained for a sufficiently long period. A short wave
or trough flattens out. Thus in any empirical formula
or system of prediction, the time over which the change
extends at the upper gauge must be taken into account,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
or else there must be several upper gauges and the
readings of all of them be taken into account.</p>

<p>In mountainous districts landslips sometimes occur
and block the valley of a stream which then forms a
lake. The water gradually rises and eventually flows
over the dam and sweeps it away causing a flood, which
is of great suddenness and height but decreases very
quickly in height as it travels down the valley. In a
case which occurred in the Himalayas in 1888 the
inhabitants of the valleys, from the dam to the point
where the river debouches from the hills, were compelled
by Government to vacate all habitations below
the probable level of the flood, and no loss of life
occurred. Similar floods, but on a smaller scale, may
be caused by the bursting of ordinary reservoir dams.
In some continental rivers ice may obstruct the stream
and cause floods.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XII_Art_5">5. <b>Prevention of Floods.</b>&mdash;The extended use of
field drains has, in recent years, done much to increase
the severity of floods in England and other countries.
One method of mitigating or preventing floods is the
construction of reservoirs for storing the water. Reservoirs
locally known as “washes,” formed by setting
back the embankments, exist on the Fen rivers. One
wash, on the Nene, below Peterborough, is 12 miles
long and half a mile wide and is filled, in floods, to a
depth of 7 feet and holds 1 inch of rainfall over the
river basin, and this is found to be sufficient. Reservoir
construction is, however, in most cases, impracticable
owing to the expense. To store the water which is
given by 1 inch of rain in the basin of the Thames, a
reservoir would be needed 50 feet deep and covering
about 7 square miles. It might cost £7,000,000.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></h3>

<p>The afforestation or reforestation of river basins
(<a href="#Chap_II_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>, <i>Art. 4</i></a>) is also occasionally undertaken, but
is not generally practicable.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>The most practicable methods for preventing flooding
are lowering the water-level of the stream and constructing
embankments along it. These will be considered
in the next two articles.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XII_Art_6">6. <b>Lowering the Water-Level.</b>&mdash;The water-level of
a given length of stream can be lowered by lowering the
bed, widening the channel or straightening the channel.
The efficiency of these processes is in the order named.
As stated in <a href="#Chap_I_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>, <i>Art. 4</i></a>, the alteration to the channel
must in any case be continued to some point downstream
of the reach under consideration. Let the channel be
supposed to be of “shallow” section with sloping sides.
Let W be the mean width, D the depth, and S the slope.
Let it be required to lower the water-level by an amount
equal to D/5. This can be effected by lowering the bed
by about 25 per cent. of D, or by increasing the width
by about 50 per cent., or by increasing the slope by
about 100 per cent. If the bed is lowered, V is not
affected, and the mean width is reduced. Increase in
W reduces D, and therefore reduces the hydraulic radius
and the velocity. Hence the large amount of widening
necessary. When S is increased the velocity, if R
remains the same, is affected only as √S (<i>Hydraulics</i>,
<span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i>), but the depth of water is reduced
and R therefore reduced. Dressing the sides of a
channel, so as to make it smoother, produces the same
effect as a slight widening.</h3>

<p>It does not, of course, follow that lowering the bed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
is always the best plan and straightening the worst.
Any one of the processes may be more or less impracticable
because, for instance, of the hardness of the
material to be removed, or the expense&mdash;including
compensation&mdash;of removing obstructions.</p>

<p>A particular kind of widening consists in digging a
new channel and keeping both the new and the old
channel open.</p>

<p>If a channel contains a weir, or a local raised portion
of bed forming a kind of submerged weir, or a contracted
place or narrow bridge, the upstream water-level
can be lowered by simply removing or reducing the
obstruction. The lowering of the water-level will be
greatest at the site of the obstruction, and will be zero
at some point far upstream (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>,
<i>Art. 5</i>). If the raised portion forms a long shoal, its
removal&mdash;supposing its height above the general bed to
be the same&mdash;will have more effect than if it were
short. If the height of the raised portion is small
compared to the depth of water, or the amount of contraction
small compared to the width of the stream, the
removal may have much less effect than might appear
(<a href="#Chap_I_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>, <i>Art. 4</i></a>).</p>

<p>In soft soils one advantage of the straightening
system for lowering the water-level is that short-cuts
can be dug to a small section, and left to enlarge
themselves (<a href="#Chap_VII_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. VII.</span>, <i>Art. 1</i></a>).</p>

<p>Another advantage is that after any diversions have
enlarged themselves to the size of the rest of the
channel&mdash;or have originally been so excavated&mdash;the
whole channel may scour, and the water-level continue
to fall. This, of course, should be allowed for if likely
to occur.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<p>The same thing may occur in the case of the removal
of a weir, shoal, or contracted piece of channel. The
scour will act at first close to the site of the obstruction,
but it may work upstream.</p>

<p>In widening or deepening a channel for the purpose of
mitigating floods, it is a good plan to begin work at the
downstream end, because the lowering of the water-level
will extend upstream beyond the reach in which work
is done, and this may facilitate work further upstream.
As regards any tendency for a widened reach to silt up
again, any such silting is not likely to be great in a
short period of time, and need not prevent the carrying
on of work in various reaches, if this is convenient.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XII_Art_7">7. <b>Flood Embankments.</b>&mdash;A flood embankment
may be close to the edge of the river or it may be set
back. If set back it need not follow all the windings
of the stream. The setting back of an embankment
gives an increased waterway to the stream during floods,
and therefore a lower flood-level, but the effect of this
is trifling in cases where the depth of the water on the
flooded land is small, especially if such land is covered
with vegetation, or is otherwise much obstructed.
Setting back is generally necessary in cases where the
stream is liable to erode the banks to any considerable
extent. In such a case the embankment should not be
so near to the river as to be in much danger from
erosion, but the ground, as already stated (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_9"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>,
<i>Art. 9</i></a>), generally falls, in going away from the river,
so that when an embankment is set well back it is in
lower ground, more expensive and more liable to breach.
The most suitable alignment is a matter of judgment,
and depends largely on the extent to which the river
is likely to shift.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></h3>

<p>Embankments should, where possible, be made in
straight or properly curved reaches. A flood embankment,
at least at its upstream end, should terminate in
ground which is above flood-level. The top of an embankment
should be, in the case of a large river, 2 or
3 feet above the high flood-level of the river. It should,
of course, be graded parallel to the general high flood-level,
but neither the gradient nor the height of the flood is
usually known with accuracy (<a href="#Chap_II_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>, <i>Arts. 1</i></a> and <a href="#Chap_II_Art_2"><i>2</i></a>).
There is generally a record or mark of some high flood,
and this is taken provisionally as the flood-level. Or
the level is calculated approximately from the flood
readings on the nearest river gauge. If experience
shows that the embankment is too low, it is raised.
The cross-section of an embankment depends on the
soil, on the extent of damage which results if a breach
occurs, on the funds available, and on the value of the
land which the embankment has to occupy.</p>

<p>Where an affluent enters the river it will probably be
necessary to run out branch embankments. Sometimes
cross embankments are run from the main embankment
to high land. Their object is to localise the damage if
a breach occurs. Along the back of the embankment
there may be a drain and it can be made to discharge
its water, when the river is not in flood, through the
embankment by means of sluices or by pipes closed by
flap valves which will not allow flood water from the
river to pass through. There may be sluices in the
embankment for the purpose of irrigating the land at
the back.</p>

<p>The immediate effect of the construction of flood
embankments along a river is to raise the water-level,
because the floods can no longer spread out over the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
country, but this effect will not be great if the sectional
area of the flood water was small or its velocity low.
The river may or may not tend, after the construction
of flood embankments, to raise or lower its bed.
It has already been remarked that questions of
silting or scouring cannot be answered in a general
manner. In the case, however, of floods spilling over
a piece of country, the depth of the flood water is
generally small and the country more or less obstructed.
Some deposit of silt generally occurs. The construction
of an embankment reduces the area of the flood water,
and thus generally reduces the silting and leaves more
silt in the river proper. The depth and velocity in the
river are increased. Everything depends on which is
increased most. Most likely the stream is of shallow
section and the velocity is increased most (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_6"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>,
<i>Art. 6</i></a>, par. 6), and the increased silt-supporting power
may make up for the increased charge of silt.</p>

<p>Sometimes when a main embankment is set far back,
a subsidiary embankment of smaller section is constructed
closer to the stream. This is often objectionable.
The smaller embankment is liable to breach, and
the water then rises suddenly instead of gradually
against the main embankment, which is thus endangered
to some extent, especially as it is dry instead of being
soaked.</p>

<p>It is often said that one effect of embanking a reach
of a river is to increase the severity of floods further
downstream. The importance of this is generally
exaggerated. The narrowing of the flood stream in the
embanked portion causes the flood to travel more
quickly and rise higher in that particular reach. At a
place further downstream the same effect is produced,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
but in a less degree and only because of the increased
velocity and consequent reduction in the flattening out
of the flood wave, especially when the rise is soon
succeeded by a fall. When there is a gradual rise
lasting for a considerable time&mdash;and this is most likely
to cause a high flood&mdash;there is no rise of the flood-level
downstream of the embanked reach, except such as is
due to the increase in the discharge of the stream
consequent on the absorption and evaporation being less
than before, owing to the reduced area of flooding in the
embanked reach. In the case of a long-continued rise,
such as that just mentioned, it is the reach immediately
upstream of the embanked reach which will, to some
extent, share in the increased height of the floods.</p>

<p>An embankment may suitably have side slopes of 4
to 1 on the river side and 3 to 1 on the land side, with a
top 10 feet wide and 3 feet above high flood-level. On
the Irrawaddy the top width is generally 8 feet. For
very high and very low embankments it is 10 feet and
3 feet respectively. In Holland 1 foot above high flood-level
was at one time supposed to be the rule, but in
practice it was usually 4 feet. With sandy soil the
riverward slope prescribed was 6 to 1. Such flat slopes
are not necessary if fascining or stiff soil is used as a
protection. On the Rhine the top width of embankments
consisting of gravel and sand has been made
about 15 feet, but the side slopes were 1½ to 1 and 1 to
1. The embankments had spurs to keep off the current.</p>

<p>Sand, protected as above, makes a good embankment,
and rats do not burrow into it. Of course, if a breach
occurs in an embankment consisting mainly of sand, it
will enlarge very quickly. In some cases an embankment
has a core wall of sand or of clay puddle. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Holland, on sandy soil, a trench 8 feet wide is made and
taken down to the clay.</p>

<p>Embankments require to be made with great care.
The earth should be deposited in layers. In Holland,
horses are driven up and down over each layer. In
some parts of India the earth for embankments is
brought from the borrow pits by scoops drawn by
bullocks. The earthwork is of so excellent a character,
owing to the earth being trodden down, that no settlement
has to be allowed for. Where the soil is sand the
top and faces of the embankment should be of good stiff
soil, if it can be obtained, for a thickness of 9 inches or
a foot, or else the face next the river should be protected
by fascining (<a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>) for 2 feet above, and
several feet below high flood-level. Such protection
may be necessary in any case where waves are liable to
occur. In Holland embankments are turfed, and trees
and shrubs are not allowed to grow. In the Punjab the
growth of all kinds of jungle is encouraged. It binds
the soil together and protects it from the wash of waves
and from winds which blow away sand and dust, and so
wear the embankment slowly away.</p>

<p>In embanking a long reach of a river it is convenient
to begin from the upstream end, because otherwise floods
may get behind the finished part of the embankment
and, becoming impounded in a “pocket” formed by the
embankment and high land, rise to an abnormal height
and, unless gaps in the embankment have been left or
are subsequently made, cause breaches.</p>

<p>During high floods pegs should be driven in at
frequent intervals, to mark the high flood-levels. If
a higher flood occurs, the peg is shifted. The levels of
the pegs can be observed at leisure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>When a breach occurs in an embankment, the first
thing to do is to protect the ends so that the breach
shall not lengthen. If the water passing through a
breach becomes pocketed, the embankment may have to
be cut to let it out.</p>

<p>Regarding the stoppage of leakages, see <a href="#Chap_IX_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>,

<span class="large">RESERVOIRS AND DAMS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_XIII_Art_1">1. <b>Reservoirs.</b>&mdash;The object of a reservoir is to store
water for town supply or for irrigation or other
purposes. Reservoirs for the water supply of towns are
divided into “impounding reservoirs” and “service
reservoirs,” the latter being of comparatively small size,
and their object being to store, near to the town, a
supply sufficient for a short period. Instead of one
impounding reservoir there may be several, formed by
various dams and one discharging into another. When
a reservoir is mentioned without qualification, an impounding
reservoir is meant. A reservoir is generally
made by blocking up a valley by means of a dam of
earth or masonry. The site of the dam should be
selected at a place where the valley is narrow. The
lowest portion or “bottom water” of a reservoir is
usually not drawn upon, because it is less pure than
the rest, and it has to be left, in dry weather, for the
fish. It is not included in calculating the capacity of
the reservoir.</h3>

<p>In Great Britain, when the water of a stream is
impounded, “compensation water” has to be given
back to the stream lower down. This compensation
water is generally given in the form of a constant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
supply, and amounts to perhaps a quarter of the
available supply. It has to be included in calculating
the daily supply taken out of the reservoir. The
advantage to the stream in having this addition to it
during dry weather is very great.</p>

<p>It has already been seen (<a href="#Chap_IX_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>, <i>Art. 1</i></a>) that
in an earthen bank which has to retain water the
leakage generally decreases rapidly and the bank
becomes almost impermeable. The same is true of the
surface of a valley, in the case of most ordinary soils,
provided that it is kept submerged. Any portions
which become exposed to the sun and weather are likely
to crack and give rise to percolation. Thus a reservoir
formed by the construction of a dam resting on the
surface of the ground may be more or less water-tight
according to circumstances. There are many which are
sufficiently water-tight. But in most cases the dam&mdash;or
an impervious core-wall&mdash;is carried down to an
impervious stratum. A masonry dam is carried down
to rock.</p>

<p>In the case of dams of considerable height the soil
should be examined by borings. If there is an inclined
stratum not well connected with that below it, unequal
settlement of the dam may occur; and this may also
happen if there is a thick stratum of clay, owing to
its compressibility.</p>

<p>Except for very high dams&mdash;those, for instance, more
than 110 or 120 feet in height measured from the
ground to the water-level&mdash;an earthen dam is cheaper
than a masonry dam. It is also more easily raised and
strengthened&mdash;though this operation has also been
effected on masonry dams&mdash;in case, for instance, of the
silting up of the reservoir, a process which is slow in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
England, but not so slow when water containing much
silt is dealt with, as in the case of irrigation reservoirs
in India. Sometimes a dam consists of a wall of
masonry or concrete with earth behind it as a support.
Whatever kind of dam is used, its construction always
demands very great care. Serious disasters, with much
loss of life, have occurred owing to failures of dams.</p>

<p>A reservoir with an earthen dam is provided with
a waste weir for the purpose of passing off flood water,
which might otherwise overtop the dam and destroy it.
Generally the waste weir is a continuation of the line of
the dam. Its crest has to be below the high-water level
of the reservoir, but not lower than can be helped, and
its length has therefore to be considerable. Sometimes it
is provided with grooved piers between which planks are
placed in the season when floods are not likely to occur.</p>

<p>In connection with irrigation reservoirs in Western
India, it has been pointed out by Strange (<i>Min. Proc.
Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. cxxxii.) that a long high-level waste
weir is best suited to cases in which the replenishment
of the reservoir is uncertain, and that in cases where it
is nearly certain, the high-level weir prevents the water-level
in the reservoir being quickly lowered in the case
of an accident or for the purpose of effecting repairs,
impounds the earliest floods, which are most charged
with silt, and causes the water area to be a maximum,
and therefore gives all floods the maximum time in
which to deposit silt. He accordingly suggests that
the crests of waste weirs in these reservoirs should be
shortened and lowered and provided with falling shutters
(this had been done in one reservoir and has since been
done in another), and that sluices be added with sills at
a still lower level than the lowered crest. These proposals
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
seem to be entirely reasonable, though of course
it would be necessary to have skilled supervision over
the working of the sluices. Sometimes the waste weir
is made in a separate place, being separated from the
dam by a saddle.</p>

<p>A masonry dam may act as its own waste weir, the
flood water flowing over the crest and down the rear
slope; but in cases where heavy floods are liable to occur
it is usual to provide a separate waste weir by cutting
away the side of the gorge either close to the dam or at
some other place.</p>

<p>While a dam is in course of construction arrangements
must be made to deal with flood water. Generally the
construction of some part of the dam has to be deferred
to let the water pass. In the case of a masonry dam
it does not much matter what part is thus deferred
provided the usual procedure of stepping the work back
is followed. In the case of an earthen dam it is best to
defer a portion, not in the lowest ground where the dam
is highest, but to one side of it, thus allowing the highest
part of the dam to be brought up continuously. Temporary
embankments and weirs can be constructed to
cause the water to traverse the desired route without
doing damage. Stepping of the earthwork should be
avoided as far as possible. If it has to be adopted, the
steps should be small. Sometimes the flood water is
conveyed away by means of a “by-wash,” by an
entirely different route.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_57" src="images/fig_57.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57.</span></p></div>

<p>In Indian reservoirs the discharge over the waste weir
may at times be great. The waste weir is sometimes in
the position shown in <a href="#fig_57">fig. 57</a>, <i>a e</i> being the weir. In
such a case a special hydraulic problem arises. In a
case where a stream whose velocity is V issues from a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
reservoir or takes off at right angles from a larger stream
there is (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>, <i>Arts. 19</i> and <i>20</i>) a fall
in the water of about V<sup>2</sup>/2<i>g</i>. The same thing occurs downstream
of a weir, at least when there is a clear fall which
is vertical or nearly so, so that the water after falling
has no horizontal velocity. The water has to be started
afresh on its course. In the case represented by the
figure, the width of the channel is often restricted
because of high ground beyond <i>f</i>, and the velocity in
the channel may be very high. Suppose the channel
below <i>e f</i> to be of brickwork with vertical sides, and to
have a 20-foot bed, a slope of 1 in 500, and a depth of
water of 10 feet. The velocity may be 15 feet per
second, and V<sup>2</sup>/2<i>g</i> is 3·49 feet. If the water has a clear fall
over the weir at <i>e</i>, allowance must be made for a depth
of water of 13·49 feet, not 10 feet, in the channel at <i>e</i>.
Ordinarily the length <i>a e</i> will be much greater, relatively
to <i>e f</i>, than shown in the figure. Suppose that <i>a e</i> is 300
feet and that the slope of the floor of the channel is
carried on at 1 in 500 from <i>e f</i> up to <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
following in each case the lines marked on the figure which
represent the directions of flow. The length <i>f a</i> will be
about 310 feet, and the floor level at <i>a</i> will be about ·62
feet higher than at <i>e f</i>. The water-levels below the weir
will be in each case 13·49 feet above the floor. This
should be allowed for in the design. It is true that the
stream on first starting into horizontal motion below the
weir moves more or less at right angles to it, and has
thus a large sectional area and a low velocity; but it very
soon has to turn parallel to the weir and acquire the full
velocity of 15 feet per second, and there must be the
requisite extra head to give this velocity. If the weir is
drowned, the water on passing over it may have a high
horizontal velocity, but it will be at right angles to the
axis of the channel, and its effect will be wasted in eddies.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XIII_Art_2">2. <b>Capacity of Reservoirs.</b>&mdash;A reservoir depends
for its supply on the yield of a particular valley or
valleys which form its catchment area, and the capacity
of the reservoir or reservoirs can be altered by altering
the height or number of the dams. The need for a
reservoir is entirely owing to the inequality in the
distribution of the rainfall. If the rain fell in equal
quantities week by week, the daily fluctuations could
probably be equalised by the service reservoirs. The
impounding reservoir could be quite small. Actually, a
reservoir is needed to “equalise” the flow&mdash;that is, to
give a steady flow for an intermittent one. The smaller
the reservoir, the sooner it will go dry in a drought and
the sooner it will overflow in wet weather and cause
waste of the water. In other words, the larger the
reservoir the better it will fulfil its function of equalising
the flow and the greater the degree to which the
catchment area will be utilised.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_58" src="images/fig_58.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 58.</span></p></div>

<p>In the British Isles the distribution of the rainfall
which is most trying for a reservoir, occurs when the
rain is heavy during the winter and very light in
summer. Fig. 58 shows a diagram for a reservoir in
the driest year, when the rainfall is (<a href="#Chap_II_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>, <i>Art. 1</i></a>)
·63 of the mean annual fall. The distribution of the
fall is supposed to be unfavourable as just described.
The lower part of the figure shows the water-level at
the end of each month, the reservoir being supposed to
have vertical sides so that the quantity of water in it is
proportional to the depth of water. The upper part of
the figure shows the water impounded (available fall
multiplied by area of catchment) in full lines, and the
consumption in a dotted line. The distance between
the two lines in any month is the same as the rise or
fall of the reservoir in that month. There is supposed
to be no overflow, and the total consumption of water in
the year is equal to the quantity impounded in the year,
so that the levels of the reservoir water surface on 1st
January and 31st December, as shown by the horizontal
lines A, B at the left and right of the figure, are the
same. Deacon, who has investigated the subject, has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
found (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, Tenth Edition, vol. 33, “Water
Supply”) that, in order to satisfy the above conditions,
the capacity of the reservoir must be 30 per cent. of the
water impounded during the year, or about 110 days’
consumption. On 1st January the reservoir must be
about two-thirds full. At the end of February it is
ready to overflow. At the end of August it is just
becoming dry. The daily consumption is supposed to
be steady throughout the year.</p>

<p>As an instance, suppose the catchment area to be
1000 acres, the mean annual fall 60 inches, with a loss
from evaporation and absorption of 14 inches. The
available rainfall of the year is (see last column of table
below) 23·8 inches, or 1·983̇ feet. The water impounded
and consumed during the year is 1000 × 43,560 × 1·983̇
× 6·25 = 539,962,000 gallons. The reservoir capacity
must be 3/10ths of this, or 161,988,600 gallons. This is
represented by the height C E. If the mean available
rainfall in January and February is 6·3 inches, or
·525 feet, the water impounded during those months is
1000 × 43,560 × ·525 × 6·25 = 143,931,000 gallons, and
the consumption is 539,962,000/6 = 89,993,667 gallons.
The difference, 53,937,333 gallons, represents the addition
A C, to the reservoir. Similarly, the light summer
rainfall causes the depletion A E, and the heavy rainfall
in the last four months of the year the addition E B.
If the height of the reservoir above A B were less than
A C, there would be overflow at the end of February; and
if the depth below A B were less than A E, the reservoir
would go dry before the drought ended. If the capacity
of the reservoir were increased either at the top or
bottom, the cost would be increased and nothing would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
be gained. It is not meant that the highest and lowest
levels of any reservoir designed as above would always,
in the driest year, exactly correspond with the points of
overflow and going dry, but they would do so nearly.
Deacon states that such a reservoir would fail only once
in fifty years, and then only for a short time.</p>

<p>The reservoir considered above does not, as already
remarked, fully utilise the yield of the catchment area.
In a wetter year there would be overflow and the yield
from the reservoir would not be much increased. In
order to equalise the flow of the two driest years the
capacity of the reservoir must be increased, its yield
being also increased, and so on for larger groups of
years. By collecting information for large numbers of
places in the British Isles, Deacon has prepared
diagrams and tables which show the capacities and
yields of reservoirs. The following table gives the
figures for the case where the rainfall is 60 inches and
the loss by evaporation and absorption 14 inches:&mdash;</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
<a href="#Chap_II_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap. II.</span>, <i>Art. 1</i></a>. The figures in the last column show
the corresponding available falls, after deducting the loss

the available falls for the shorter periods are reduced
in a greater ratio than the figures in the fifth column.</p>

<p>In arranging for the supply of towns in the British
Isles it is usual to design the reservoirs so as to equalise
the flow of the three driest consecutive years. Existing
reservoirs, old and new, usually contain from 140
to 170 days’ supply, but some contain less. The above
table shows that for the assumed fall of 60 inches and
loss of 14 inches, the capacity of a reservoir, to allow
for a six-year dry period, has to be 49 per cent. more
than for a three-year dry period, while the daily supply
from it is only 13 per cent. greater.</p>

<p>The following statement gives Deacon’s figures for
mean annual rainfalls ranging from 30 to 100 inches.
The columns marked R show the reservoir capacities
in millions of gallons, and those marked S the daily
yields of the reservoirs in thousands of gallons. The
figures for other falls can be interpolated. For a fall
of, for instance, 50 inches, the figures, whether of R
or S, are practically a mean between those for falls of
40 and 60 inches.</p>

<p>In all cases the loss is supposed to be 14 inches
annually. If it is 15 or 13 inches, the reservoir
capacity is less or more by about five, ten, or fifteen
million gallons, according as the number of years in
column 1 is 1, 3, or 6. And the daily yield is less or
more by about 50,000 gallons.</p>

<p>With a low rainfall the advantage of a large reservoir
is somewhat increased. The capacity of the six-year
reservoir for a fall of 30 inches is 63 per cent. more
than that of the three-year reservoir, but the supply is
22 per cent. greater.</p>

<p>The figures given above for reservoir capacities are
suitable for the British Isles. They assume that the
distribution of the rainfall is the least favourable that
is at all likely to occur. Deacon states that the figures
do not relieve the engineer of the exercise of judgment.
As regards the British Isles, the chief questions on
which judgment has to be exercised are whether to
equalise the flow of three years or of another number,
and how much to allow for loss. As already stated,
three years is the period usually taken. The figures are
suitable for most places in Europe, but in some places, <i>e.g.</i>
on the Mediterranean coast, the distribution of the rainfall
is somewhat less favourable than in the British Isles.
In other parts of the world, and notably in or near the
tropics, the distribution of the rainfall must be specially
studied, and a diagram be prepared on the same
principle as in the case of <a href="#fig_58">fig. 58</a>. The diagram should
be extended to cover the desired number of years. In
hot countries loss by evaporation from the surface of
the reservoir should be allowed for. In India during
the hot dry months this loss may be half an inch in
twenty-four hours.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>In the article above quoted it is shown that if, as
commonly happens, the consumption of water is, in
summer, greater than the mean, and in winter less,
the conditions are still more trying for the reservoir;
and that in the case where the summer consumption is
13 per cent. greater than the mean, the capacity of the
reservoir which impounds the water of the driest year
must be 33 per cent., instead of 30 per cent., of the
total supply impounded during the year. It would then
contain 121 days’ instead of 110 days’ mean supply.
In the table on page 170 the number of days’ supply is
113. From this it appears that the tables from which
extracts have been given are calculated on the basis
of a constant consumption. This, however, in the
case where the number of years whose supply is
equalised is greater than one, makes, owing to the
increased size of the reservoir, no practical difference.</p>

<p>The calculations for the great reservoirs in Radnorshire
for the supply of the city of Birmingham are as
follows (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. clxxx.). The ratio
of the mean fall in the three driest years to the mean
annual fall was taken as ·80 instead of ·77. There is
some difference of opinion as to the best figure:&mdash;</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XIII_Art_3">3. <b>Earthen Dams.</b>&mdash;Before an earthen dam is made,
any soft soil on the site should be removed and the
ground downstream of the site should be drained. A
few trenches, running parallel to the axis of the dam,
can be dug so as to give the dam a hold, though there
is never any danger of its being moved horizontally
by the thrust of the water. If the ground has a side-long
slope it should be benched as shown in <a href="#fig_59">fig. 59</a>.
The front slope of an earthen dam is generally about
3 to 1, and the rear slope about 2 to 1. The top has
a width of ⅓ to ½ the greatest depth of water held up,
and is 5 to 10 feet above the highest water-level. The
borrow pits from which the earth for the dam is got
should not be near enough to it to in any way affect
its stability.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_60" src="images/fig_60.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 60.</span></p></div>

<p>In England, and generally in other countries, an
earthen dam has a core-wall (<a href="#fig_60">fig. 60</a>) which is carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
down to an impervious stratum, and is keyed into it
to a depth of a foot or more in the case of hard rock
and several feet in the case of clay. On this core-wall
the impermeability of the dam chiefly depends. The
core-wall may be of clay puddle, concrete, or masonry.
In England it is generally of clay puddle. The core-wall
sometimes extends down to a depth of 100 or 200
feet. Its top is horizontal and about level with the
highest water-level. It is desirable not to make the
foundation stepped, but to let it follow the profile of
the impervious stratum. The wall is keyed at its ends
into the sides of the valley or gorge. A core-wall of
concrete or masonry is, in a high dam, necessarily a
comparatively thin structure, and it may be subjected
to great strains by unequal pressures of the earth which
surrounds it. It is therefore to some extent liable to
crack. A core-wall of concrete used for the water-works
of Boston, U.S.A., is 100 feet high, 8 feet thick at the
base, and 4 feet thick at the top. A clay-puddle wall,
being plastic and moist, at least during the period
immediately succeeding the construction of the work,
is not very liable to crack. The top width of a puddle
wall may be 4 to 10 feet, and the batter of the sides
from 1 in 20 to 1 in 8. The clay used for the wall
above the ground-level should contain about 33 per
cent. of sand and stones. This diminishes its shrinkage
if it dries. It should not be given too much water in
mixing. It should be thoroughly mixed and worked up
and trodden down.</p>

<p>The clay puddle and the earth of the dam should be
carried up uniformly. The allowance for settlement
may be 1/30 to 1/50. The earth should be deposited in
thin layers, moistened and rammed, and all clods broken.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
In India and some other countries, instead of the earth
being rammed, cattle or sheep are driven over it
repeatedly. This makes earthwork of most excellent
quality, and the settlement, if any, is very small.</p>

<p>In cases where, owing to a fissure in the rock below
the bottom of the puddle trench, water comes through
under the puddle, it is usual to carry it away in a pipe
running vertically in a groove up the side of the trench
and then horizontally till it emerges from the dam.
Such water, and any other leakage, can often in Great
Britain be used as part of the compensation water.
There is, however, a certain chance, when there are
water-bearing fissures in the rock below the bottom of
the trench, that some percolating stream of water may
wash away the puddle, and it is preferable to use a
concrete core-wall in such cases, carrying it up to about
ground-level and keying it into a much thicker wall of
puddle which is carried up to the water-level.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the clay puddle or other
impervious layer should be placed, not vertically and
in the middle of the dam, but lying on the upstream
face of the dam, so as to keep out water from the whole
dam instead of from only half of it. Objections to this,
if clay puddle is used, are that vermin may bore holes
in it, and that, with some clays, it would slip. These
objections might be overcome to some extent by laying
a pitching of concrete blocks over the puddle. Other
objections, applying also when masonry or concrete is
used, are that the superficial area and cost are increased,
and that cracks would occur from settlement of the
earth and from changes of temperature when the water
in the reservoir was low. A good many cases have
occurred in which an impervious layer laid on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
slopes has failed from one cause or another. In France
it is usual to rely on such a layer&mdash;concrete is used&mdash;and
to dispense with a core-wall. The practice of
having a vertical wall appears to be the best, and is
the most widely adopted. When puddle is used the
weight of the mass above it forces it to completely
fill the trench, and when once it is in position and
covered up it is not at all likely to be damaged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_61" src="images/fig_61.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span></p></div>

<p>The outer portion of a high embankment sometimes
slips (<a href="#fig_61">fig. 61</a>), and precautions should be taken against
this. A slip may occur if the site of the dam has not
been carefully selected as to geological formation, or if
there is unequal settlement owing to the work having
been done at different times. One cause of slips is
sudden and partial changes in the degree of saturation,
and another cause is excessive saturation. Some clays
when wet require extremely flat side slopes, and will not
stand even at 5 to 1. The outer parts of the embankment
are not required for stopping percolation (this
will be further considered in the following paragraph),
and, though they must be carefully laid and consolidated,
they should be of porous material, and the part on the
downstream side of the dam must be well drained. A
series of surface drains may be arranged and filled with
loose stone and gravel. There is also a distinct advantage
in using heavy material such as small stone for the lowest
portion of the outer parts on both sides of the dam.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
When good material cannot be obtained, the side slope
on the downstream side of the dam may be flattened.
A side slope starting at the top with 3 to 1 and
becoming 4 to 1 lower down, and finally 5 to 1 at the
base, is a very good form for prevention of slipping and
generally for the safety of a dam. The part on the side
next the reservoir is not likely to slip. It becomes
soaked, but it has the pressure of the water against it
and is pitched. In Madras, where reservoirs are very
numerous, the slope on the side next the water is
generally only 1½ to 1.</p>

<p>The different parts of an earthen dam fulfil two
distinct functions. Some parts, which may be called
the staunches, have to stop the percolation of water from
the reservoirs. Other parts, which may be called the
supports, have merely to hold up the staunches. In the
British type of dam the portion nearest the core-wall on
either side (<a href="#fig_60">fig. 60</a>) is generally made of earth specially
selected for impermeability. The distance to which it
extends from the wall depends partly on the quantity
of such earth available. In any case it has to be very
carefully made and consolidated, to avoid unequal
pressures on the core-wall, or unequal settlement which
might cause it to part from the wall. One of its
functions is to keep the core-wall moist when the water-level
in the reservoir falls. Whether it is also to be
considered as a staunch or a support might at first
appear to be of no consequence, but it is of importance
as affecting the question of drainage. The support on
the downstream side of the dam must, as has just been
seen, be made of porous material and be well drained;
but obviously a staunch must not be porous, nor can it
be penetrated by drains. The question must be decided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
in each case according to judgment. In a discussion
which took place on the above-mentioned paper by
Strange, at the Institution of Civil Engineers, much
diversity of opinion was expressed among eminent
engineers as to the desirability of draining the downstream
half of the dam, <i>i.e.</i> the part downstream of the
core-wall. By some it was urged that drainage is
necessary to lessen the chance of the earthwork slipping.
Others contended that any drain which penetrates the
dam must facilitate the percolation of water from the
reservoir. It is clear that some of the speakers regarded
the dam downstream of the core-wall as being partly
staunch, and some as being wholly support. If for any
reason there seems a chance of water leaking through
the core-wall, it is desirable to regard the earth-filling
next to it as staunch.</p>

<p>In Western India a kind of puddle is made by mixing
three parts of “black cotton soil” with two of sand.
The object of the puddle wall is only to prevent water
from finding its way along the surface of the ground. It
is carried down only to a fairly water-tight stratum and
is carried up only to 1 foot above the ground. Above
that the mass of the dam is made of black cotton soil as a
staunch, with more porous material on both sides of it.</p>

<p>In order to afford full protection against waves and
their splashes, the pitching on the upstream face of a
dam should extend up to a height of 5 feet, measured
vertically, above the highest water-level. In the case
of a dam in which the “fetch” or distance over which
the waves have been in process of formation exceeds
two miles, the above height should be slightly increased.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
The pitching is usually of stones roughly squared
at their outer ends and laid on a layer of broken
stones.</p>

<p>The water from a reservoir is usually drawn off by
means of pipes which are laid inside a masonry culvert
built under the dam. The pipes can thus be inspected.
The culvert is blocked at its upstream end by a thick
masonry wall through which the pipes pass. Accidents
which have happened in the past have been due to
weakness of the culvert or to water finding its way
along the outside of the masonry. The culvert can be
made of proper strength, and it should have a thick
coating of clay puddle which is worked into the clay-puddle
core-wall of the dam. If the core-wall is of
masonry or concrete, the masonry of the culvert is
properly joined to it. In many cases the culvert and
pipes are taken through a cutting or tunnel and not
under the dam.</p>

<p>At the upstream end of the culvert there is a masonry
tower&mdash;access to it is obtained from the top of the dam
by a foot-bridge,&mdash;and from it valves for opening and
closing the pipes are worked. If the reservoir is for the
water supply of a town, it is arranged, by means of a
vertical pipe, that the draw-off can be at various levels
so that the surface-water can always be used. In the
case of some of the towers at the reservoirs whence
Birmingham is now supplied, the vertical pipe consists
of a number of steel cylinders with gun-metal faces
which are so accurately made that the joint is water-tight
when one cylinder merely stands on another. The
draw-off is obtained from a given level by lifting a
particular number of cylinders. Sometimes the tower
is made of reinforced concrete. When it is lofty it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
should be strong enough to resist a strong wind, blowing
when the reservoir is empty.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XIII_Art_4">4. <b>Masonry Dams.</b>&mdash;For heights much exceeding
110 or 120 feet a masonry dam may be cheaper than an
earthen dam; and in case a flood occurs while work is in
progress the masonry might suffer little injury, while
earthwork might be swept away completely. Masonry
dams are usually built of random rubble masonry with
faces of dressed stone. Such masonry weighs about
140 lbs. per cubic foot, and is ordinarily quite safe when
subjected to pressures of 20 tons per square foot, but in
a masonry dam a high factor of safety is necessary, and
15 tons per square foot may be allowed. In a wall of
such masonry with both faces vertical, the pressure,
owing to the weight of the wall, will reach the above
limit when the wall has attained a height of about
220 feet.</h3>

<p>In a masonry dam, although the masonry is always
of the best quality, it is a rule to calculate the dimensions
so as to give no tension on any part of the masonry.
Any crack or opening of a joint, occurring perhaps
before the masonry had hardened, would let in water,
and its pressure would tend to gradually extend the
crack and eventually to overturn the portion above the
crack.</p>

<p>Fig. 62 shows the upper part of a masonry dam.
The lines with arrows show the vertical force due to the
weight of the masonry above A B, the horizontal force
due to the water-pressure on it&mdash;acting at two-thirds of
the depth,&mdash;and the resultant of these two. In order
that there may be no tension on the masonry, the
resultant must always fall within the middle third of
the thickness of the dam. In order to prevent its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
falling outside the middle third, the downstream face
must be splayed out, and the splay will go on increasing
somewhat. Suppose, now, that the reservoir is laid dry.
It will be found that in the case of a dam more than
100 feet high the pressure due to the weight of the
wall alone will fall outside the middle third&mdash;to the
upstream side of it, of course&mdash;of the thickness of the
wall, and a slight splay must be given to the upstream
side. The vertical pressure of the water on this
splayed part must be taken into consideration. The
limit of pressure, 15 tons per square foot, may eventually
be reached owing to the height of the dam, and
additional splay may have to be given for this. When
the outside splay becomes considerable a further
allowance is made for it, because the stress at the edge
of a horizontal section is tangential to the face. In
order that the tangential stress may not exceed 15 tons
per square foot, the vertical stress at the outer edge of
a horizontal section of the dam must not exceed about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
12 tons. By following the above rules the section of
the dam can be calculated, beginning from the top and
working downwards. The resulting profile of the dam
is somewhat as shown in <a href="#fig_63">fig. 63</a>. If a masonry dam is
designed on the principles given above&mdash;that is, so as to
be safe as regards crushing and overturning&mdash;it will be
safe as regards shearing or sliding horizontally, but a
test calculation can easily be made for this.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 63.</span></p></div>

<p>Calculations of the above kind do not, of course,
enable all the stresses in a solid mass of masonry to be
found. Great stresses are caused by expansion and
contraction owing to changes in temperature. Others
are caused by the connections of the dam with the
rock on which it rests and with the sides of the gorge.
The method of calculation described above indicates a
suitable form for the profile of a dam. The large factor
of safety adopted allows for other stresses. The
sections of the oldest dams, made in Spain, were somewhat
as shown in <a href="#fig_64">fig. 64</a>, and contained about twice as
much material as was necessary. The object of the
calculations is to save this needless expenditure.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<p>Masonry dams designed on the above principles have
been constructed for heights ranging up to nearly
300 feet, measured from the foundation to the top.
The foundation is always on hard rock free from fissures.
Generally a foundation trench is cut. The ends of the
dam are carried into the rock on the sides of the gorge.
They should not, however, if the sides of the gorge
are steep, be built in with mortar, but be allowed to
expand and contract vertically, a water-tight joint being
made by means of asphalt (<i>Ency. Brit.</i>, Tenth Edition,
vol. 33, “Water Supply”). This obviously reduces the
straining. A dam should be built in cool weather, so
that any stresses to which it will eventually be subjected
owing to changes in temperature will be chiefly compressive.
The upstream face should be as water-tight
as possible. There should not, however, be too sudden
a change in the character of the masonry from the
face work to the inside work. If there are any
springs, they must be carefully connected to pipes
and carried outside the dam. No water must be
permitted to get under or inside the dam, either
from springs in the sides of the gorge or from the
water in the reservoir. Many existing dams leak
slightly where they join the sides of the valley,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
and most have developed some vertical cracks normal
to the face.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_64" src="images/fig_64.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 64.</span></p></div>

<p>Out of some hundred high masonry dams which have
been erected, only three are known to have failed. Of
these, the Puentes dam was partly founded on piles; and
in two, the Habra and Bouzey dams, the rule of the
middle third was not attended to. Another dam, not
so high, the Austin dam, in Texas, U.S.A., failed seven
years after construction. It was 65 feet high and
founded on limestone, the width of the base being
66 feet. Springs in the bed and sides of the gorge had,
during the construction of the dam, given much trouble,
and had, after its completion, forced their way through
the underlying rock. At the time of failure 11 feet of
water was passing over the dam, which sheared in two
places, a length of 440 feet of it being pushed forward
for 40 or 50 feet without overturning, but subsequently
breaking up. The dam was founded in a trench cut in
the rock. The rock on the downstream side of the
foundation trench appears to have been worn away
by the water, so that there was no longer a trench
(<i>Scientific American</i>, 28th April 1900). The above,
however, does not seem to be sufficient to account for
failure. The horizontal water-pressure on a 1-foot
length of the dam would be 180,000 lbs. and the
weight of masonry to be moved perhaps 320,000 lbs.
It seems probable that water from upstream found its
way under the dam and exercised a lifting force on
it and so caused it to slide.</p>

<p>If a masonry dam, instead of being straight, is made
curved on plan, with its convexity upstream, it acts as
an arch, and its thickness can, in the case of a fairly
narrow gorge, be greatly reduced. This type of dam is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
a suitable one to use when the sides of the gorge are
of firm and solid rock and there is no doubt about
their being able to stand the thrust without yielding.
Several dams of very considerable size have recently
been built in this way. The thickness of the upper
part of the dam and the ratio of the versed-sine of the
arch to the span can be decided on by the methods
used for arches in general. The lower part of the dam
is made thicker. The lowest part cannot act as an
arch, because it is attached to the foundation. It is,
however, assisted by the portion above it, which acts as
an arch, and thus need not be so thick as in a “gravity”
section. The Bear Valley dam, which is 64 feet high,
is only 3 feet thick at the top. The thickness increases
gradually to 8½ feet at 48 feet from the top. The chord
of the curve is 250 feet and the radius of curvature
335 feet. If the gorge is wide, the thickness of the
arch comes out so great that nothing is saved by
adopting the curved form. But in such a case, and in
any case, a dam can be made slightly curved so as to
offer a greatly increased resistance to overturning. It
need not act as an arch, and can be prevented from so
acting, in order that excessive stresses may be avoided,
by letting the ends of the dam, after they have entered
the grooves cut in the sides of the gorge, stop short of
the ends of the grooves.</p>

<p>During the last few years much attention has been
given to the investigation of the stresses to which a
masonry dam is subjected. Some investigations have
been theoretical and others practical, models of india-rubber
and other substances having been used for
experiment. The investigations show that generally
the stresses in a model of a dam are very much the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
same as would be expected, but that there is a tensile
stress, previously overlooked, near the point M (<a href="#fig_65">fig. 65</a>),
where the dam rests on its foundation. The tension is
on the foundation, on the line M N, and is due to the
horizontal thrust of the water. It is natural that in
an elastic model this stress should manifest itself by
deformation. In the case of an actual dam resting on
rock, matters are different; but this tensile stress deserves
consideration. For the present let it be supposed that
there is no trench, the dam merely standing on the rock.
Suppose that the rock has only the thickness M R.
There is tension in M N, and probably compression in
N R. It is assumed that, along the base M P, there is
perfect union between the dam and the rock. The
tension to which the rock is occasionally subjected
owing to changes of temperature may exceed any
tension due to the water-pressure, but it is conceivable
that the tension occurring from both causes might cause
a crack at M N, and that this might extend to R. This
implies a minute sliding of the dam and of the rock
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
below it, movement taking place on the plane R Q.
The thrust of the water is now resisted by the rock
downstream of P Q. The dam, with the rock M R Q P
adhering to it, tends to rotate about the point P. The
tendency to rotate will be enhanced if water enters M R,
and still more if it enters R Q. No rotation can, however,
take place unless the rock at M R is splintered away.
The rock would also have to fracture at P Q. It has
been suggested that the upstream face of the dam be
made curved as shown by the dotted line. This would
shift the chief tension to <i>m n</i>, and the dam, with the
rock beneath it and the weight of the water above the
curved portion, would obviously offer an increased resistance
to rotation about P. The cost of the dam would of
course be increased. The danger of a crack forming at
M N seems to exist only when there is a thin upper
stratum of rock not firmly connected to rock below.
When this condition is believed to exist, a masonry
dam, if built at all, should have the upstream face curved
as above described. In the case of any existing dam of
great height, when the above condition is suspected to
exist, the reservoir might be laid dry, and if any crack
at M N is discovered a curved portion could be added;
but in this case the union between the new and the old
work would be imperfect, and the curve should start from
high up on the upstream face of the dam. It has been
suggested that asphalt or some impervious material be
laid on the rock to prevent water from entering any
crack. It would, however, not only have to be laid
upstream of the dam, but to extend under part of the
dam, and thus weaken it to some extent.</p>

<p>In the case (<a href="#fig_63">fig. 63</a>) in which the dam is founded
in a deep trench, the building up of the upstream
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
triangular space and uniting the material both to the
dam and to the side of the trench, might be of some use,
but a crack might form in it. It would be desirable to
add a curved portion, as above described, on the top of the
rock if sound, or to remove the unsound rock and widen
the trench and then add the curved portion. Adding
material to the downstream triangular space, and uniting
it well, would also increase the resistance of the dam
to overturning, not so much because of the additional
weight, as because of the raising of the point about
which the dam would have to revolve in overturning.</p>

<p>Several recent dams have been built of cyclopean
concrete, blocks of rock as heavy as 10 tons being
sometimes used in the work. Such blocks are laid on
one of their flat faces. In the U.S.A. some reservoirs
have been made with walls of reinforced concrete, backed
by earth embankments (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol.
clxxxix.), and also of cyclopean masonry reinforced
with steel rods. Another kind of dam which has been
used in the U.S.A. is the rock-fill dam with a core&mdash;corresponding
to the puddle wall in an earthen dam&mdash;of
steel plates riveted together and made water-tight
and inserted into the rock at each side. In the case of
the East Canyon Creek Reservoir, Morgan, Utah, the
dam is 110 feet high. The steel plates vary in thickness
from 3/8-inch at the bottom to ¼-inch at the top, and are
embedded in asphaltum concrete and rest on a concrete
base. The dry-stone work of the dam is hand-packed on
both faces, and also on both sides of the core. The rest
is thrown in. The upstream face is 1 to 1, and the downstream
face 2 to 1. The waste weir is at one end of the
dam and is continued by a flume, so that the water falls
clear of the dam. The outlet is a tunnel in the rock.

<span class="large">TIDAL WATERS AND WORKS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_XIV_Art_1">1. <b>Tides.</b>&mdash;The tides or “tidal waves” are caused by
the attraction of the moon and the sun. The phenomena
are complex, and a full discussion of their causes need
not be given here. When the tide rises it is said to
“flow,” and it is called the flood tide; when it falls it
is called the ebb tide. The period between one tide
and the next, <i>e.g.</i> from high water to high water, is about
twelve hours, twenty-five minutes. At a spring tide
the range of the tide is greater than usual; at a neap
tide less. Where there are channels, as, for instance, the
seas which surround the British Isles, the tidal waves
run up them as the tide rises in the neighbouring ocean,
and run back as it falls. At some places, as Southampton,
the tide comes in from two directions, and there is a
double tide. The times and levels of high and low
water at various places have been ascertained by
observation, and are recorded. The levels are, however,
liable to be affected by winds. A wind blowing towards
the shore raises the level of both high and low water; a
wind blowing off shore lowers both levels. A severe
storm in the North Sea has caused a double tide at
London Docks, by accelerating the North Sea tidal
wave.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></h3>

<p>In a funnel-shaped estuary, especially if it faces the
direction of the tidal wave in the sea, the tide in going
up the channel increases in velocity, and the momentum
of the water causes it to rise higher and higher as the
width decreases. At the upper end of the Bristol
Channel the range of the tide is double the range in the
sea outside the channel. The Bay of Fundy is another
place where a similar phenomenon occurs. When a
river or estuary is shallow and the range of the tide is
great, so that its rise is rapid, the flood tide in some
cases advances in the form of a wave or “bore,” causing a
sudden rise in the water-level and a sudden reversal of
the flow of the stream. A bore is most pronounced at
spring tides. That of the Severn is well known.</p>

<p>In the case of a tide running along a coast or up an
estuary, the water of the flood tide, after it has ceased
to rise, continues for a short time, owing to its
momentum, to flow in the same direction as before.
The same thing happens when the ebb tide ceases to
fall. The tide also acquires special velocity, just as a
river does, round any projecting headland.</p>

<p>The rise and fall of the tide are least rapid near the
turns of the tide. If the time from the beginning to
the end of the flow be divided into six equal parts, the
proportional rise of the water will be approximately as
follows. And similarly with the fall during the ebb.</p>

<p>Tidal waters are frequently charged, more or less,
with silt, obtained from the shore or from shallows near
it, either by currents or tidal waves sweeping along it,
or by the action of ordinary waves. Tidal waters flowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
up and down the lower portions of rivers render
them to an enormous degree more capable of carrying
navigation and, especially if they become enlarged and
form estuaries, more capable of being altered by training
works.</p>

<p>A tide-gauge is constructed on the same principle as
a self-registering stream-gauge. The rise and fall of
the water are reduced, by mechanism, to a convenient
range, and are recorded on a band carried on a drum,
which is caused to revolve by clockwork. Another kind,
which depends on the use of an inverted syphon filled
with air and a syphon of mercury, is described in <i>Min.
Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>, vol. clxiv.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_66" src="images/fig_66.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 66.</span></p></div>

<h3 id="Chap_XIV_Art_2">2. <b>Tidal Rivers.</b>&mdash;Let A B (<a href="#fig_66">fig. 66</a>) be the surface
of the lower part or mouth of a river, supposed to be of
uniform width, and let B be the mean sea-level. As
the tide rises to D the water of the river is headed up
and assumes the line A D. When the tide falls to F
there is a draw, the river surface taking the line A F.
If the rise of the tide B H is so great that the discharge
of the river cannot keep pace with it, so as to fill up the
whole space between A and H to the level of H, there
will be a flow of sea water from H to some point M, and
of river water from A to M. The point M will be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
lower than A and H. If the tide now turns and the
water-level H begins to fall, there will still be a flow
along H M. For a brief period it will be due to
momentum, but it will continue until, by the rise of
the water-level at M and the fall at H, the surface has
assumed the form indicated by the dotted line A N J.
While this is happening, the point corresponding to M&mdash;where
the concave curve of the upland water meets
the convex curve of the tidal water&mdash;rises higher and
shifts seaward. The character of the two curves remains
the same, but they become flatter and the surface N J
nearly level.</h3>

<p>Thus the time of high tide at M is later than at H.
It is later for each point passed in going up the river
from H towards A. Eventually a point A is reached
where there is no tide, that is, no rise or fall. Far
below this point, between A and B, there is a point
above which there is no upward current but only a
slackening of the downstream flow. At H a diagram
showing the rise and fall of the tide is symmetrical, at N
the rises and falls are less than at H, and the periods
of their occurrence later. In going up the river the
duration of the flood tide decreases and that of the
ebb tide increases. The flood tide attains its greatest
velocity soon after its commencement, the ebb tide
towards its close. The distances to which the tidal
influence extend are of course greater the greater the
range of the tide and the flatter the slope of the river.
The discharge of the river of course varies. The greater
the discharge the more the rise of the river tends to
keep pace with that of the tide and the less the distance
to which the tidal influence extends. On a longitudinal
section of the river, the high-water line will be shown as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
A N H. This is merely done for convenience. It is
never high water at all points simultaneously. To show
the actual state of affairs at various stages of the tide,
series of lines must be drawn as in <a href="#fig_67">fig. 67</a>, where the firm
lines show the flood, and the dotted lines the ebb tide.</p>

<p>The flow in the tidal reach of a river is the same as if
the water was alternately headed up by a movable weir
and then allowed to flow freely and be drawn down.
If the water carries silt, the tendency for deposit to
occur is (<a href="#Chap_V_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. V.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>) no greater than if there was
no heading up or drawing down. The tendency depends
chiefly on whether there is, on the average, any reduction
in velocity or increase in depth as compared with the
non-tidal upstream reach, and whether the water in
that reach is fully charged with silt. If both the answers
are in the negative, no deposit due to river silt is likely
to occur in the tidal reach.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_67" src="images/fig_67.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 67.</span></p></div>

<p>If the sea water is charged with silt, it will of
course carry silt into the river as it flows up, but the
whole volume of water which enters has to flow out again.
On the whole, the tendency for silt to be deposited in
the river is due only to the period of “slack tide” near
the time when the flow ceases. The tendency is seldom
marked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>If the sea water carries silt and the river water is
clear, the latter assists of course in removing any deposit&mdash;that
is, it tends to keep the channel clear.</p>

<p>If the river channel is soft and if the sea water carries
no silt, it may, in passing up and down the river, become
charged with silt and return to sea still carrying it. It
thus has a scouring effect on the channel, and may deepen
or widen it. If, owing, for instance, to the flattening of
the bed slope in its lower reaches, the river tends to
deposit its own silt in its tidal reach, the sea water may
prevent this deposit. Thus, as regards silting in the
tidal reach of the river, the tidal water of the sea has
little prejudicial effect if it is silt-laden, and a beneficial
effect if it is not. Silt is likely to deposit in the tidal
reach of a river of uniform width, only in a case in
which the river water carries much silt, and the slope
is flat or cross-section great compared to that of the
upper reach.</p>

<p>Sea water is heavier than fresh water by about 2·4
per cent., and this, to some extent, prevents their mixing.
At all stages of the flood tide the tendency at the point
where the fresh water meets the salt water is for the
fresh water to accumulate towards the surface and the
sea water towards the bottom. When the tide begins
to flow up the river there may be a low-level salt water
current moving landward and a high-level fresh water
current moving seaward, but this is quite a temporary
state of affairs. The surface slope is landward, and the
water moving seaward is not moving in obedience to
the surface slope. It is only moving as a result of
momentum previously acquired. The low-level current
may have some extra velocity and extra scouring power,
but this cannot be much, because the mean landward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
velocity of the whole stream must, owing to the internal
resistances caused by the two currents, be less than it
would be if there were not two currents. Moreover,
the state of affairs is temporary. The two kinds of
water mix eventually, and their temporary separation
has no considerable effect on the general tendency of
the river in the tidal reach to scour or to silt.</p>

<p>A body of water included at any moment between
any two cross-sections of the tidal portion of a river
may not reach the sea during the next ebb tide. In
this case it will flow back up the channel with the next
flood tide, and so be kept moving up and down, getting
nearer, however, to the sea at each tide.</p>

<p>De Franchimont has shown (<i>Min. Proc. Inst. C.E.</i>,
vol. clx.) how a diagrammatic route-guide can be prepared
for any tidal river to show pilots or captains of
vessels the best times for starting on voyages up or
down the river, and for passing each point on it.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XIV_Art_3">3. <b>Works in Tidal Rivers.</b>&mdash;If any works are
required in the tidal portion of a river, the principles to
be followed in designing them are the same as if the
river was non-tidal. All that has been said in <a href="#Chap_VIII_Art_1"><span class="smcap">Chap.
VIII.</span>, <i>Arts. 1</i></a> to <a href="#Chap_VIII_Art_3"><i>3</i></a>, applies to them. The river may be
straightened or trained or dredged. Generally training
and dredging are combined. Any dredging in the
portion of the river nearest the sea will not, of course,
alter the water levels near the mouth, but it will alter
them further up. The tide will come up in greater
volume and will rise higher and extend further up.
The ebb will be facilitated, and the low-water level will
be lowered. If any narrowing of the channel near its
mouth is effected by training walls for the purpose of
lowering the bed, the effect on the volume of tidal water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
entering the river must be taken into consideration. If
the narrowing is confined to a reach near the mouth, and
if the resulting deepening is not sufficient to counteract
the effect of the narrowing, the volume of tidal water
reaching the unnarrowed portions of the channel will be
reduced, and this may be injurious. Its scouring action
may be insufficient. The proper course may be to
continue the narrowing upstream. If this is done, then
it is obvious that the width of channel in which deep
water is to be maintained at high water, or which is to
be kept free from deposit, is reduced in about the same
proportion as the volume of tidal water is reduced, and
no harm is likely to result.</h3>

<p>Any weir or similar structure which abruptly stops
the flow of the tide up a river checks it of course for a
long distance back, perhaps to the mouth. Old London
Bridge used to obstruct the tide, and its removal increased
the range of the tide, and was beneficial.</p>

<p>Tidal rivers generally widen out to some extent near
their mouths, and are thus rather estuaries than rivers.
The works in such rivers are more fully discussed in
<i>Art. 5</i>.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XIV_Art_4">4. <b>Tidal Estuaries.</b>&mdash;If, instead of a river of uniform
width, there is an estuary whose width increases steadily
towards the sea so that it is funnel-shaped, the conditions
described in <i>Art. 2</i> are modified. An estuary is formed
first by the waves of the sea, which wear away the angles
at the mouth of the river and allow the tide to enter in
greater volume, and then by the flow and ebb of the
tides. The slope of the bed of the estuary is usually
much flatter than that of the river, and the water
surface is as shown in <a href="#fig_67">fig. 67</a>. The tidal movements
extend further upstream than in the case of a river, not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
only because of the greater difficulty experienced by
the upland water in filling up the wide channel of the
estuary, but because of the momentum of the tidal
water driving its way up the funnel-shaped channel
(<i>Art. 1</i>). The capacity of the estuary is of course much
greater than is required for the discharge of the upland
water alone. If the sea-level remained always at one
height and if the upland water contained silt, it would
tend to deposit in the estuary and would certainly
deposit in it to some extent. The action of the sea
water is the same as described in <i>Art. 2</i>, scouring if it
is clear when entering, of less account if it is not clear.
Owing to the funnel shape of the estuary, the tide rises
higher at its upper end than if the estuary were replaced
by a river channel, and the tide also extends
further up. This may partly or wholly compensate for
the greater tendency of silt to deposit in an estuary as
compared with a river channel.</h3>

<p>The ebb tide in an estuary does not always follow
exactly the same course as the flood tide. Of course
the lowest parts of the estuary are filled first and
emptied last, but the channels are not all continuous.
A channel open at its lower end may have a dead end
at its upper termination, and <i>vice versa</i>. Also, at sharp
bends in the channels, the momentum of the water may
cause differences in the paths traversed by the flowing
and ebbing currents. Wherever there is a deep channel
the water from the adjacent sandbanks tends, towards
the close of the ebb, to flow cross-wise into the channel,
and in doing this it to some extent washes down the
banks into the channel.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XIV_Art_5">5. <b>Works in Tidal Estuaries.</b>&mdash;Estuaries, when
shallow, offer great facilities for training. It used at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
one time to be said that any change which reduces the
volume of tidal flow must be injurious. It would be
injurious to restrict the mouth of the estuary, unless it
were exceptionally wide, and leave the rest untouched.
If the whole estuary is narrowed, and a suitable funnel
shape preserved, the width to be kept open is, relatively
to the size of the mouth, no greater than before, and the
tide may flow up as far as before, and rise to as high a
level. The narrowing, if properly arranged, will improve
the shape of the estuary and cause an increased scour.
The effect of the upland water is also greater in the
narrower channel. Improvements to estuaries are not,
however, restricted to training. There is always one or
more deep channels, and the best of these can be selected
and improved by dredging. The channel should be one
along which both the flood tide and the ebb tide will
run. The above remarks as to training do not apply to
a case in which there is a bar outside the mouth of the
estuary. Training might check the scour at the bar.
Bars are treated of in <a href="#CHAPTER_XV"><span class="smcap">Chap. XV.</span></a></h3>

<p>If an estuary is not funnel-shaped, if, for instance, it
widens out very rapidly, the tidal flow is much less
effective in keeping the channel open. In this case,
training works, which would give the necessary funnel
shape, are indicated rather than dredging. If an estuary
is narrow at the entrance, the flow is much less powerful,
unless the narrow part is of greater depth, but even
then the force of the tide is reduced owing to the change
in the shape of the channel.</p>

<p>The bed of an estuary may be of such soft or sandy
material that a dredged channel would be likely to be
quickly filled up again by the slipping in of material
at the sides (<i>Art. 4</i>). In such a case an untrained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
channel can only be kept open to its full depth by
constant dredging, and probably the best course is to
construct a trained channel, although it may be more
expensive than in the case of a harder channel, because
of the depth to which the foundations of the walls must
be sunk into the soft bed. Also, if the bed of the
estuary is constantly shifting, a dredged channel alone
will not succeed, and training must be resorted to.
Again, the bed may be of such hard material that
training walls would not cause it to scour. In this case
a channel should be dredged and need not be trained.
For the great body of intermediate cases in which the
deep channel can be formed either by dredging or
training, both methods can be adopted. A common
plan is to train the upper part and to dredge the lower
part where the estuary is wider and the training walls
would be more exposed to the waves.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_68" src="images/fig_68.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 68.</span></p></div>

<p>When an estuary is thus partly trained, the deepening
due to the training does not extend far beyond the
point where the walls terminate. The deposit of
material along the sides of the estuary may, however,
extend some distance further down in places where the
tide can no longer have free play. This occurred in the
Seine estuary (<a href="#fig_68">fig. 68</a>). The authorities of Havre,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
which lies at one side of the estuary not far from its
mouth, feared that if the training walls were brought
further down, the deposits might extend to their
neighbourhood. The reduction in the capacity of the
estuary, due to the deposits, caused it to become filled
up more quickly, and the time of high water at Havre
was advanced. The dotted lines show a good arrangement
of training walls proposed by Harcourt.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that it is always feasible to carry
training walls right through an estuary, or at least
down to a point where deep water is reached, and if a
proper funnel shape is given to the channel the reduction
of the tidal flow and silting up of the spaces behind the
walls need not cause any trouble. Training the complete
estuary was carried out in the case of the Tees,
where, however, the estuary was not of great length, and
was not of a good shape for keeping itself open. Any
affluents entering the estuary can be provided with
separate trained channels. Difficulty may, however,
arise if there are towns which would be shut off from
the estuary by the silt banks.</p>

<p>Generally the line selected for the trained or dredged
channel should, though it must be as short and direct
as possible, coincide as nearly as possible with that
which the water naturally tends to keep open. This
may be toward one side of the estuary or the other,
according to the direction from which the tidal wave
approaches. In the case of the Dee, the best line was
not adopted, attention having been chiefly given to the
question of silting up the spaces outside the walls and
so reclaiming land, a matter which should always be
treated as of quite secondary importance. Training
walls in estuaries are generally built only up to half-tide
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
level. Were it not for the expense they might be
built up to high-water level. In the Seine estuary the
walls were made of blocks of chalk.</p>

<p>Whether a trained channel will keep itself open or
will need periodical dredging depends, of course, on the
amount of silt in the water and on its velocity and
depth. The question must be worked out and calculated
as in the case of a non-tidal river.</p>

<p>The estuary of the Mersey differs from most others.
Towards the mouth, near Liverpool, it is narrow and it
widens out further inland. The tides, running through
the narrow portion, to fill up the large inland basin
and to empty it again, keep the narrow part scoured to
a great depth. It was proposed to train the wide
portion for the Manchester Ship Canal. The training
would, no doubt, have succeeded, but, owing to the
silting up of the greater part of the estuary, the scouring
near Liverpool would have been very greatly reduced
and serious damage done to that port.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="large">RIVER BARS</span></h2>

<h3 id="Chap_XV_Art_1">1. <b>Deltaic Rivers.</b>&mdash;When a river flows into a tideless
sea its silt deposits and forms a shoal or bar.
This shoal may in time extend and rise up to the water-level.
The current of the river makes its way through
it in various directions, and in this way a delta is formed
and constantly extends seawards. This flattens the
slope of the lower portions of the river, and causes
raising of the bed in the reaches upstream, and this
again may cause the water to break out further
upstream and form fresh channels to the sea. The bars
at the mouths of deltaic rivers are generally formed
with great rapidity, and they are apt to form a complete
hindrance to navigation. They are sometimes partly
scoured away by floods in the river, but in this case the
scoured material may deposit on the outer slopes of the
bar. If a river which carries silt has no delta, it is
probably because there is a littoral current, which
prevents the silt from depositing. On the other hand,
if a river brings down very heavy sediment, a delta
may be formed even when tidal flow is not wholly
absent. This occurs in the case of the Ganges.</h3>

<p>The bars at the mouths of deltaic rivers cannot usually
be kept down by dredging except at great expense.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
The usual method of dealing with them is to run out
two parallel jetties, in continuation of the river banks,
so as to bring the mouth of the river out to the bar.
The river then scours a channel through the bar and, if
the walls are not too far apart, the depth will probably
become as great as in the river and sufficient for navigation.
The river, however, tends to at once form a new
bar further out. The rapidity with which the new bar
forms will be greater or less as the specific gravity of
the materials carried by the river is greater or less, and
as the strength of any littoral current is less or greater.
Clay is spread far out while sand quickly sinks. All
deposits are, however, swept away if there is a strong
littoral current. The steeper the slope of the bed of the
sea away from the bar the longer the new deposit will
take in forming a fresh bar. Also the less the discharge
of the river the less the deposit will be. The branch of
a deltaic river selected for improvement by having the
bar at its mouth removed, should be one which has a
small discharge and whose mouth is in a position where
there is a strong littoral current. In the case of the
Rhone, the branch selected was the eastern one, whose
mouth was not exposed to any littoral current. Moreover,
the other branches of the river were closed, and
this increased the discharge of the branch which was left
open. The work did not succeed. In other cases, the
parallel jetty method has succeeded, and notably in the
case of the Mississippi. In this case willow mattresses
weighted with stones were used. The question of keeping
down the discharge does not, however, appear to
have always received sufficient attention. In the case
of the Mississippi the “South pass” was selected for
improvement. In order to remove a shoal its upper end
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
was narrowed and its discharge reduced. The upper
ends of the other “passes” were then obstructed so as
to restore the discharges of all the passes to their former
amounts. The wisdom of this step is questionable. It
is desirable to keep down the discharge of the branch
which is to be improved to the lowest limit consistent
with free navigation.</p>

<p>If the width of the river near its mouth is greater
than is desirable for the width between the jetties, the
latter are sometimes made to converge though their
outer ends are made parallel.</p>

<p>In the case of the Mississippi the jetties were made
with a slight curve to the right. It would seem
desirable always to make the jetties with quite a considerable
curve. The jetty which was convex to the
channel could then probably be shortened. In a case
where there is a littoral current, say to the right, the
curve of the jetties could be to the right, so that the
stream on issuing would tend to merge into the current
and assist it.</p>

<h3 id="Chap_XV_Art_2">2. <b>Other Rivers.</b>&mdash;It often happens that the materials&mdash;sand,
gravel, and shingle&mdash;of which a sea beach is
composed shift gradually along the shore. This is
known as “littoral drift.” It is by some supposed to be
due to the action of the tides, and by others to the action
of waves, the drift taking place in the direction of the
prevailing winds, excluding those which are off shore.
The latter cause is the more probable.</h3>

<p>Most rivers have bars at their mouths. In the case
of deltaic rivers the bar, as already stated, is caused
by the heavy silt carried by the river, though it may
be assisted by littoral drift. In the case of non-deltaic
rivers flowing into tideless seas, the quantity of silt is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
not enough to form a bar, and the same is generally
true in the case of tidal rivers where the volume of tidal
water is usually much greater than that of the upland
water. In both these classes of rivers the formation
of the bars is due chiefly to littoral drift or to sediment
brought in by the sea water. The bar, as in the case
of deltaic rivers, may be partly scoured away by a flood
in the river, and the scoured material may deposit on
the seaward slope of the bar. Generally, the navigation
channel across a bar of this kind can be kept sufficiently
deep by dredging, but sometimes jetties, like those
mentioned in the preceding article, have been constructed,
and in this case there is the great advantage that the
bar is not liable to form further out. If littoral drift
tends to accumulate, the jetties, or at least the one on
the side whence the drift comes, can be lengthened.
This was done, as mentioned by Harcourt (<i>Rivers and
Canals</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. IX.</span>), in the case of the rivers Chicago,
Buffalo, and Oswego, which flow into the Great Lakes
of America. The same writer states that the jetties at
the Swine mouth of the tideless river Oder were made
to curve to the left, the convex or left-hand jetty being
the shorter, but that this exposed the mouth to littoral
drift coming from the left. The river, upstream of the
jetties, had a slight curve towards the left, but this
could have been corrected or, at all events, the jetties
made to curve to the right.</p>

<p>A case (<a href="#fig_69">fig. 69</a>) where parallel jetties were recently
constructed in a tidal sea is that of the mouth of the
Richmond River, New South Wales (<i>Min. Proc. Inst.
C.E.</i>, vol. clx.).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_69" src="images/fig_69.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 69.</span></p></div>

<p>In the case of a bar at the mouth of an estuary,
parallel jetties would be too far apart. In such cases
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
converging breakwaters (<a href="#fig_70">fig. 70</a>) are sometimes made,
especially if the tidal capacity of the estuary is small.
The entrance is generally 1000 to 2500 feet wide. If
made narrow, it would reduce the tidal flow too much.
The space inside the breakwaters adds to the tidal
capacity, and thus induces scour at the bar. The case
is similar to that of the Mersey estuary (<a href="#Chap_XIV_Art_5"><span class="smcap">Chap. XIV.</span>,
<i>Art. 5</i></a>), the breakwaters assisting scour at the bar,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
though perhaps slightly interfering with the tidal flow
in the estuary.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_70" src="images/fig_70.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 70.</span></p></div>

<p>Converging breakwaters also tend to stop littoral
drift, and the space inside them acts as a harbour of
refuge in storms and as a sheltered place where dredgers
can work (<i>Rivers and Canals</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap. XI.</span>). They have
to be heavily built and are very expensive, and they
are generally adopted only when there is an important
seaport, and when they can be put to all the uses above
indicated.

<h2 id="APPENDIX_A">APPENDIX A</h2>

<p><b>Fallacies in the Hydraulics of Streams</b> (<a href="#Chap_I_Art_4"><span class="smcap">Chap. I.</span>, <i>Art. 4</i></a>, and
<a href="#Chap_VI_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art 2</i></a>).&mdash;In an inundation canal in India the supply
during floods was excessive. Orders were given that a flume
be made at the head, as shown in <a href="#fig_71">fig. 71</a>. The sides were to
be revetted, as shown in <a href="#fig_19">fig. 19</a> (<a href="#Chap_VI_Art_3"><span class="smcap">Chap. VI.</span>, <i>Art. 3</i></a>); the length,
excluding the splayed parts, was to be 200 feet, and the floor
was to be a mattress well staked or pegged down. The order
stated that “by this means we cannot get into the canal
much more than its true capacity.” With 9 feet of water,
a surface fall of 4 inches in 300 feet would give a velocity of
some 6·5 feet per second, and a further fall of about 8 inches
would be required at the head of the flume to impress this
velocity on the water. The flume would reduce the depth of
water in the canal by 1 foot, <i>i.e.</i> from 9 feet to 8 feet. This
would not be in anything like the proportion desired. Moreover
the flume, unless the bed was extremely well protected,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
would be destroyed. The above is a case of exaggerating the
effect of an “obstruction.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig_71" src="images/fig_71.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 71.</span></p></div>

<p>Again, on a branch canal it was observed that “wherever
cattle crossings exist there is a deep silt deposit which practically
blocks the branch.” The deposit exists because the sides
of the channel are worn down. A wide place always tends
to shoal (<a href="#Chap_IV_Art_9"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 9</i></a>). If the deposit obstructed the
flow of water there would be a rush of water past it, and it
could not exist.</p>

<p>The Gagera branch of the Lower Chenab Canal&mdash;the left-hand
branch in <a href="#fig_72">fig. 72</a>&mdash;was found to silt. It was proposed
to make a divide wall (<a href="#fig_72">fig. 72</a>) extending up to
full supply level. The idea is unintelligible. The silt does
not travel by itself but is carried or rolled by the water.
As long as water entered the Gagera branch, silt would
go with it. The authorities, who had apparently accepted
the proposal, altered the estimate when they received it,
and ordered the wall to be made as shown dotted and of
only half the height. This was done. The idea seems to
have been that the wall would act as a sill and stop rolling
silt. This is intelligible, but see <a href="#Chap_IV_Art_2"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 2</i></a>, last paragraph.
Moreover, there was a large gap, A B, in the wall.
The work is said to have proved useless, and proposals have
been made to continue the wall from A to B. In this form it
is conceivable that it may be of use.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72.</span></p></div>

<p>In a river, the rises and falls at different places are not, of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
coarse, the same, even when they are long continued. In the
river Chenab, at the railway bridge at Shershah, the rise from
low water to high flood is generally a foot or two more than
the rise at a point 25 miles upstream. It has been suggested
that the railway embankments, which run across the flooded
area, cause a heading up of the stream. If this were the case,
to any appreciable extent, there would be a “rapid” through
the bridge, which, if it did not destroy the bridge, would at
least be visible and audible.</p>

<p>The exaggerated ideas which often prevail regarding the
tendency of a river, when in flood, to scour out a new channel,
have been mentioned in <a href="#Chap_IV_Art_8"><span class="smcap">Chap. IV.</span>, <i>Art. 8</i></a>. Spring, in his
paper on river control, admits, when mentioning Dera Ghazi
Khan, that there was little danger, but in mentioning the
Chenab Bridge at Shershah he quotes, without disputing it, an
opinion of the opposite kind (<i>Government of India Technical
Paper</i>, No. 153, “River Training and Control on the Guide
Bank System”).</p>

the eddies formed upstream of the crest (<i>Hydraulics</i>, <span class="smcap">Chap.

upstream of a pier. A hole formed alongside a pier or

<p>For pitching of the sides, monolithic concrete is not very
suitable, because it may settle unequally and crack. For
heavy pitching, concrete blocks can be used. They can rest
on a layer of 3 to 6 inches of rammed ballast or gravel. The
toe wall, as shown in <a href="#fig_13">fig. 13</a>, page 65, is sometimes dispensed
with, the pitching being merely continued to a suitable depth
below the bed, and the bottom edge being at right angles to
the slope instead of horizontal. The portion below the bed
may be of concrete.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
